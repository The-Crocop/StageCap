1
00:00:05,762 --> 00:00:09,511
Three weird sisters met in the day of success, 

2
00:00:09,611 --> 00:00:14,069
and I have learned by the perfectest report that they have more in them than mortal knowledge. 

3
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:20,320
When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. 

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,683
Whilst I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the king, 

5
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:26,040
who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor,' 

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,857
by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time 

7
00:00:30,957 --> 00:00:38,727
with 'Hail, king that shalt be!' 

8
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:44,827
Hail, king that shalt be.

9
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:47,312
This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, 

10
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:49,748
that thou might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing, 

11
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,378
by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee.

12
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:55,955
Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.”

13
00:00:56,055 --> 00:01:04,617
Macbeth. 

14
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:07,547
Glamis thou art, 

15
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:09,223
and Cawdor; 

16
00:01:09,323 --> 00:01:14,097
and shalt be what thou art promised.

17
00:01:14,197 --> 00:01:20,498
King of Scotland. 

18
00:01:20,598 --> 00:01:27,167
Yet I do fear thy nature; It is too full o' th' milk of human kindness to catch the nearest way: 

19
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:32,417
thou wouldst be great, Art not without ambition, but without the illness should attend it. 

20
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:34,536
What thou wouldst highly, that wouldst thou holily; 

21
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,551
wouldst not play false, and yet wouldst wrongly win.

22
00:01:37,652 --> 00:01:43,896
Thou'ld’st have, great Glamis, that which cries, “Thus thou must do,” if thou have it,

23
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:48,265
And rather thou dost fear to do, than wishest should be undone.

24
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:56,628
Hie thee hither, that I may pour my spirits in thine ear and chastise with the valor of my tongue

25
00:01:56,728 --> 00:01:59,375
All that impedes thee from the golden round, 

26
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:01,642
a crown.
