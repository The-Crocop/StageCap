1
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:55,343
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

2
00:01:55,473 --> 00:01:57,509
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

3
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,306
With all due respect ...

4
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:03,505
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:05,430
Yes, of course.

6
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:08,511
As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal ...

7
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:12,546
and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.

8
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,627
I'm TC-14 at your service.

9
00:02:36,753 --> 00:02:38,550
This way, please.

10
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:47,345
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:02:47,473 --> 00:02:49,270
Make yourselves comfortable.

12
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:51,623
My master
will be with you shortly.

13
00:02:55,353 --> 00:02:57,548
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:02:57,673 --> 00:03:00,551
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

15
00:03:00,673 --> 00:03:04,427
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:06,828
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

17
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,945
Keep your concentration here 
and now, where it belongs.

18
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:12,792
But Master Yoda said I should 
be mindful of the future.

19
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:14,824
But not at the expense
of the moment.

20
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:17,751
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

21
00:03:17,873 --> 00:03:19,704
Yes, Master.

22
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,303
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

23
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:27,469
These Federation types are cowards.

24
00:03:27,593 --> 00:03:30,312
The negotiations will be short.

25
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:33,587
What? What did you say?

26
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,546
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

27
00:03:37,273 --> 00:03:38,422
I knew it.

28
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:40,703
They're here to force a settlement.

29
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:44,951
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

30
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:46,586
Are you brain-dead?

31
00:03:46,713 --> 00:03:49,432
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

32
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,386
Send a droid.

33
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:59,430
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

34
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:01,748
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear ...

35
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:03,909
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

36
00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:16,190
What is it?

37
00:04:16,313 --> 00:04:18,873
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

38
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:22,383
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

39
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:27,109
Viceroy, I don't want this 
stunted slime in my sight again.

40
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:32,312
This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.

41
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:34,867
Begin landing your troops.

42
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:38,542
My lord, is that legal?

43
00:04:38,673 --> 00:04:40,868
I will make it legal.

44
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:43,188
And the Jedi?

45
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:45,702
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.

46
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,505
Kill them immediately.

47
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:51,751
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

48
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:55,271
Captain, look!

49
00:04:56,353 --> 00:04:57,672
Shields ―

50
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,830
Sorry.

51
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,310
Dioxis.

52
00:05:10,993 --> 00:05:13,461
They must be dead by now.

53
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:16,153
Destroy what's left of them.

54
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:26,228
Oh! Excuse me.

55
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:29,186
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

56
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:31,705
Uh-oh. Blast them.

57
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,712
What is going on down there?

58
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,710
We lost the transmission, sir.

59
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:47,911
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

60
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:50,866
Well, no, but I don't ―
Seal off the bridge.

61
00:05:50,993 --> 00:05:53,587
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

62
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:55,590
I want droidekas
up here at once!

63
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:58,147
We will not survive this.

64
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:10,586
Close the blast doors!

65
00:06:16,953 --> 00:06:19,023
That will hold them.

66
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,747
They are still coming through.

67
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:31,704
This is impossible!

68
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:38,752
Where are those droidekas?

69
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:41,945
Master! Destroyers!

70
00:06:48,113 --> 00:06:49,432
They have shield generators!

71
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,427
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

72
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:59,822
They're no match for droidekas.

73
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,545
Sir!

74
00:07:01,673 --> 00:07:04,233
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

75
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:15,233
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

76
00:07:16,913 --> 00:07:19,473
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

77
00:07:19,593 --> 00:07:22,551
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

78
00:07:22,673 --> 00:07:24,152
Let's split up.

79
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:27,345
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

80
00:07:27,473 --> 00:07:29,225
You were right
about one thing, Master.

81
00:07:31,113 --> 00:07:33,673
The negotiations were short.

82
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:37,102
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

83
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:39,224
It's Queen Amidala herself.

84
00:07:39,353 --> 00:07:41,662
At last we are getting results.

85
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:45,871
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

86
00:07:45,993 --> 00:07:48,951
You will not be so pleased when you 
hear what I have to say, Viceroy.

87
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:52,622
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

88
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:55,187
I was not aware of such failure.

89
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:57,907
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now ...

90
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:00,627
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

91
00:08:00,753 --> 00:08:02,903
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

92
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:05,308
You must be mistaken.

93
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:07,344
Beware, Viceroy.

94
00:08:07,473 --> 00:08:10,067
The Federation
has gone too far this time.

95
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:14,072
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

96
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,582
You assume too much.

97
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:18,032
We will see.

98
00:08:19,593 --> 00:08:23,427
- She's right. The senate will never ―
- It's too late now.

99
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:26,386
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

100
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:30,665
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

101
00:08:35,953 --> 00:08:39,548
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

102
00:08:39,673 --> 00:08:41,743
How could that be true?

103
00:08:41,873 --> 00:08:46,025
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

104
00:08:46,153 --> 00:08:49,748
It must ― handiwork ―
negotiate ― ambassadors ―

105
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:52,387
- nobody would ―
- Senator Palpatine.

106
00:08:52,513 --> 00:08:54,310
What's happening?

107
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,230
Check the transmission generator.

108
00:08:56,353 --> 00:09:00,983
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

109
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:03,308
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

110
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:07,062
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

111
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:09,912
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

112
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:13,105
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

113
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,463
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

114
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:19,108
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

115
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:21,224
Our security volunteers
will be no match ...

116
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,389
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

117
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:28,462
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

118
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:06,391
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship ...

119
00:10:06,513 --> 00:10:08,549
and there is no trace of the Jedi.

120
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:11,312
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

121
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:13,788
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

122
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:18,065
Use caution. These Jedi are 
not to be underestimated.

123
00:10:31,313 --> 00:10:33,031
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

124
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:35,744
Get down!

125
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,106
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

126
00:10:48,993 --> 00:10:50,665
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

127
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:52,749
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

128
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:54,431
I spake.

129
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,589
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

130
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:59,466
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

131
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,505
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

132
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:04,624
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

133
00:11:04,753 --> 00:11:07,506
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

134
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,464
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

135
00:11:17,473 --> 00:11:19,145
You saved my again.

136
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:21,070
- What's this?
- A local.

137
00:11:21,193 --> 00:11:23,627
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

138
00:11:23,753 --> 00:11:26,984
More?
"More" did you spake?

139
00:11:27,113 --> 00:11:31,789
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

140
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:34,985
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

141
00:11:36,553 --> 00:11:38,350
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

142
00:11:38,473 --> 00:11:40,191
Can you take us there?

143
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,431
On second thought, no.

144
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:44,942
- Not really, no.
- No?

145
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:47,109
'Tis embarrassing ...

146
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:51,021
but my afraid
my've been banished.

147
00:11:51,153 --> 00:11:54,111
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

148
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:57,145
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

149
00:11:57,273 --> 00:12:00,151
- You hear that?
- Yah.

150
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:03,868
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

151
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:06,461
If they find us,
they will crush us ...

152
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:10,950
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

153
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:12,711
Oh.

154
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,824
Yousa point is well seen.

155
00:12:14,953 --> 00:12:17,183
Dis way. Hurry!

156
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:25,424
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

157
00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:27,350
Ah, my warning you.

158
00:12:27,473 --> 00:12:31,432
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

159
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:34,750
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

160
00:12:44,753 --> 00:12:47,062
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

161
00:13:30,513 --> 00:13:33,311
So good bein home!

162
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:51,501
Hey, yousa.
Stopa dare.

163
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,863
Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.

164
00:13:53,993 --> 00:13:55,790
Mesa back.

165
00:13:55,913 --> 00:13:58,711
Noah gain, Jar Jar.
Yousa goen tada bosses.

166
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,347
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

167
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,426
How wude.

168
00:14:16,713 --> 00:14:19,022
Yousa cannot bees hair.

169
00:14:19,153 --> 00:14:23,510
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

170
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:28,309
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

171
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:31,869
Wesa no like da Naboo.

172
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:34,666
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

173
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:37,591
Day tink day brains so big.

174
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:41,672
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

175
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:43,988
Mesa no tink so.

176
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:46,866
Day not know of uss-en.

177
00:14:46,993 --> 00:14:49,791
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

178
00:14:49,913 --> 00:14:53,144
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

179
00:14:53,273 --> 00:14:57,869
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

180
00:14:57,993 --> 00:15:00,427
Then speed us on our way.

181
00:15:00,553 --> 00:15:02,942
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

182
00:15:03,073 --> 00:15:05,746
We could use a transport.

183
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:08,592
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

184
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:11,671
Da speediest way tooda Naboo ...

185
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:16,309
'tis goen through the planet core.

186
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:18,230
Now ...

187
00:15:18,353 --> 00:15:20,071
go.

188
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:22,343
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

189
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:24,429
Master, what's a bongo?

190
00:15:24,553 --> 00:15:26,430
A transport, I hope.

191
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:28,544
Deysa setten yousa up.

192
00:15:28,673 --> 00:15:32,143
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

193
00:15:33,593 --> 00:15:36,266
Any help here would be hot.

194
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:39,350
Master, we're short on time.

195
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:42,947
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

196
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:44,950
This Gungan may be of help.

197
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,905
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?

198
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:54,743
Hisen to be pune-ished.

199
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:56,952
I saved his life.

200
00:15:57,073 --> 00:15:59,462
He owes me
what you call a "life-debt."

201
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:03,268
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

202
00:16:03,393 --> 00:16:05,623
Binks ...

203
00:16:05,753 --> 00:16:09,541
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

204
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:17,785
Begone wit him!

205
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:22,628
Count me outta dis one.

206
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:25,745
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

207
00:16:25,873 --> 00:16:28,865
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

208
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:49,026
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

209
00:16:49,153 --> 00:16:52,270
- Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o ...

210
00:16:52,393 --> 00:16:57,228
buta a small part of it
would be mesa ... clumsy.

211
00:16:57,353 --> 00:17:01,949
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

212
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:18,392
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

213
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:20,469
Yud-say boom da gasser ...

214
00:17:20,593 --> 00:17:23,266
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

215
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:32,224
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

216
00:17:42,593 --> 00:17:46,472
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

217
00:17:57,393 --> 00:18:00,465
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

218
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:03,471
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.

219
00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:07,825
They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.

220
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:12,469
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

221
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:15,426
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

222
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,863
You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.

223
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:20,790
Yes, my lord.

224
00:18:22,193 --> 00:18:24,946
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

225
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:29,385
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

226
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:37,262
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

227
00:18:37,393 --> 00:18:40,066
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

228
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,864
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

229
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:46,468
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

230
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:54,343
Wesa dyin' here.

231
00:18:54,473 --> 00:18:57,033
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

232
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:59,986
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

233
00:19:00,113 --> 00:19:04,868
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

234
00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:08,308
Power's back.

235
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:10,424
Monster's back!

236
00:19:17,953 --> 00:19:19,625
Relax.

237
00:19:19,753 --> 00:19:21,152
You overdid it.

238
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:39,189
Head for that outcropping.

239
00:19:39,313 --> 00:19:41,144
Oh, boy.

240
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:17,024
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

241
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:19,713
Ah, victory.

242
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:34,743
Dis'n loverly.

243
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,903
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

244
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:47,026
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

245
00:20:47,153 --> 00:20:50,190
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

246
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:53,623
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

247
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,712
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.

248
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:00,824
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

249
00:21:00,953 --> 00:21:02,511
Process them.

250
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:04,351
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

251
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,031
Roger, roger.

252
00:21:58,673 --> 00:22:00,789
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

253
00:22:00,913 --> 00:22:02,471
Get their weapons.

254
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,383
Yousa guys bombad!

255
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:10,228
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

256
00:22:10,353 --> 00:22:12,150
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

257
00:22:12,273 --> 00:22:14,025
The negotiations
never took place.

258
00:22:14,153 --> 00:22:16,428
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

259
00:22:16,553 --> 00:22:18,544
They've knocked out
all our communications.

260
00:22:18,673 --> 00:22:21,870
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

261
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:29,591
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

262
00:22:29,713 --> 00:22:33,103
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

263
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:36,145
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

264
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,867
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

265
00:22:38,993 --> 00:22:40,949
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

266
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:42,552
They can't afford to kill her.

267
00:22:42,673 --> 00:22:44,709
There is something else behind 
all this, Your Highness.

268
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,710
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

269
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,710
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

270
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:51,108
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

271
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:53,588
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

272
00:22:53,713 --> 00:22:57,501
Either choice presents 
great danger ... to us all.

273
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:59,430
We are brave, Your Highness.

274
00:22:59,553 --> 00:23:02,670
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

275
00:23:02,793 --> 00:23:05,148
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

276
00:23:06,153 --> 00:23:07,871
Be careful, Governor.

277
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:18,424
We'll need to free those pilots.

278
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:21,430
I'll deal with that.

279
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:25,742
Halt.

280
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:27,465
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

281
00:23:27,593 --> 00:23:29,106
I'm taking these 
people to Coruscant.

282
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:32,305
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

283
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:34,947
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

284
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:36,904
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

285
00:23:42,153 --> 00:23:43,302
Come on. Move!

286
00:23:48,473 --> 00:23:49,383
Go!

287
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:17,064
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

288
00:24:20,713 --> 00:24:22,783
Hello, boyos.

289
00:24:28,873 --> 00:24:30,431
There's the blockade.

290
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:41,991
The shield generator's been hit!

291
00:24:50,153 --> 00:24:51,666
How wude!

292
00:25:01,273 --> 00:25:02,786
We're losing droids fast.

293
00:25:03,593 --> 00:25:06,107
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

294
00:25:08,193 --> 00:25:09,387
The shields are gone.

295
00:25:17,193 --> 00:25:18,467
The power's back!

296
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:24,463
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

297
00:25:24,593 --> 00:25:27,061
Deflector shields up at maximum.

298
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:39,822
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

299
00:25:39,953 --> 00:25:42,706
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

300
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,903
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

301
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:46,625
It's small, out of the way, poor.

302
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,425
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

303
00:25:48,553 --> 00:25:50,350
How can you be sure?

304
00:25:50,473 --> 00:25:52,304
It's controlled by the Hutts.

305
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:55,106
You can't take Her Royal Highness 
there. The Hutts are gangsters.

306
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:57,428
- If they discovered her ―
- It'd be no different than landing ...

307
00:25:57,553 --> 00:25:59,350
on a system controlled
by the Federation ...

308
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:01,464
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her ...

309
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,584
which gives us the advantage.

310
00:26:07,873 --> 00:26:10,751
And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?

311
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:14,343
She has disappeared, my lord.

312
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:18,466
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

313
00:26:19,113 --> 00:26:21,388
I want that treaty signed.

314
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,469
My lord ...

315
00:26:23,593 --> 00:26:26,027
it's impossible to locate the ship.

316
00:26:26,153 --> 00:26:28,269
It's out of our range.

317
00:26:28,393 --> 00:26:30,543
Not for a Sith.

318
00:26:31,113 --> 00:26:32,910
This is my apprentice ...

319
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:34,864
Darth Maul.

320
00:26:36,153 --> 00:26:39,304
He will find your lost ship.

321
00:26:43,473 --> 00:26:45,668
This is getting out of hand.

322
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:47,749
Now there are two of them.

323
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:50,751
We should not
have made this bargain.

324
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:59,223
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

325
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:02,106
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

326
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:05,430
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

327
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,029
R2-D2, Your Highness.

328
00:27:10,153 --> 00:27:11,506
Thank you, R2-D2.

329
00:27:15,153 --> 00:27:16,506
Padmé.

330
00:27:17,993 --> 00:27:20,029
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

331
00:27:20,153 --> 00:27:22,030
It deserves our gratitude.

332
00:27:23,753 --> 00:27:25,232
Continue, Captain.

333
00:27:28,073 --> 00:27:29,825
Your Highness,
with your permission ...

334
00:27:29,953 --> 00:27:32,592
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

335
00:27:32,713 --> 00:27:35,910
It's in a system far beyond the 
reach of the Trade Federation.

336
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:38,501
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

337
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:41,431
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

338
00:27:44,713 --> 00:27:46,351
Hello.

339
00:27:46,473 --> 00:27:49,306
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

340
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:51,786
I'm Padmé.

341
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:54,784
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

342
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:56,821
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

343
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:02,469
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

344
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:06,108

348
00:28:21,953 --> 00:28:24,911
- That's it ― Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

349
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:28,946
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

350
00:28:45,513 --> 00:28:48,186
The hyperdrive generator's gone, 
Master. We'll need a new one.

351
00:28:48,313 --> 00:28:50,668
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

352
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:53,785
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

353
00:28:53,913 --> 00:28:55,869
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

354
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:04,022
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

355
00:29:04,153 --> 00:29:05,586
Wait!

356
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:07,986
Wait.

357
00:29:11,273 --> 00:29:14,026
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

358
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:17,748
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

359
00:29:17,873 --> 00:29:19,864
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

360
00:29:19,993 --> 00:29:22,029
The queen wishes it.

361
00:29:22,153 --> 00:29:23,984
She's curious about the planet.

362
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,385
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

363
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:45,352
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

364
00:29:46,593 --> 00:29:50,142
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

365
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:52,070
The few spaceports 
like this one ...

366
00:29:52,193 --> 00:29:54,388
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

367
00:29:54,513 --> 00:29:56,344
Like us.

368
00:29:57,633 --> 00:30:00,306
Dissen berry, berry bad.

369
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,271
Icky, icky goo!

370
00:30:15,753 --> 00:30:18,062
We'll try one of 
the smaller dealers.

371
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,351
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

372
00:30:31,473 --> 00:30:35,352
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

373
00:30:37,993 --> 00:30:39,790
My droid has a readout 
of what I need.

374
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:52,030
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

375
00:30:52,153 --> 00:30:53,950
We'll find what you need.

376
00:30:56,353 --> 00:30:57,991
Don't touch anything.

377
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:10,666
- Are you an angel?
- What?

378
00:31:10,793 --> 00:31:14,342
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

379
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:17,226
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

380
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:19,821
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

381
00:31:20,593 --> 00:31:24,108
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

382
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:27,908
I listen to all the traders and 
star pilots who come through here.

383
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:32,151
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

384
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:36,061
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

385
00:31:36,193 --> 00:31:38,388
How long have you been here?

386
00:31:38,513 --> 00:31:42,347
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

387
00:31:42,473 --> 00:31:45,067
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt ...

388
00:31:45,193 --> 00:31:47,787
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

389
00:31:47,913 --> 00:31:49,631
You're a slave?

390
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:53,712
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

391
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:57,428
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

392
00:32:09,353 --> 00:32:10,832
- I got ya.
- Hey!

393
00:32:10,953 --> 00:32:12,625
Hit the nose.

394
00:32:17,113 --> 00:32:20,503
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

395
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:23,147
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

396
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:26,629
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

397
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:29,552
Saying of which ...

398
00:32:29,673 --> 00:32:31,948
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

399
00:32:32,073 --> 00:32:34,029
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

400
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:35,905
Republic credits?

401
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:38,831
Republic credits are no good out 
here. I need something more real.

402
00:32:38,953 --> 00:32:41,945
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

403
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:45,543
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

404
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:47,425
No, they won't!

405
00:32:47,553 --> 00:32:51,546
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

406
00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:55,746
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

407
00:32:56,553 --> 00:32:59,784
No money, no parts, no deal.

408
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:04,270
And no one else has a T-14 
hyperdrive, I promise you that.

409
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:14,946
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways if 
I wasn't so good at building things.

410
00:33:18,553 --> 00:33:20,350
We're leaving. Jar Jar.

411
00:33:22,873 --> 00:33:25,307
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

412
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:27,185
I was glad to meet you too.

413
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:46,751
Yippee!

414
00:33:52,553 --> 00:33:54,828
And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?

415
00:33:54,953 --> 00:33:56,750
A few containers of supplies.

416
00:33:56,873 --> 00:33:59,785
The queen's wardrobe, maybe, but 
not enough for you to barter with ...

417
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:02,143
not in the amount
you're talking about.

418
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:05,071
All right. I'm sure another 
solution will present itself.

419
00:34:05,193 --> 00:34:06,512
I'll check back later.

420
00:34:07,273 --> 00:34:08,865
Noah gain. Noah gain.

421
00:34:08,993 --> 00:34:11,712
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

422
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:14,188
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

423
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:17,350
Not likely. We have nothing 
of value. That's our problem.

424
00:34:31,993 --> 00:34:33,346
Are you going to pay for that?

425
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,070
It costs seven wupiupi.

426
00:34:42,153 --> 00:34:43,427
Oops.

427
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,550
Is this yours?

428
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:51,345
Who, mesa ―

429
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:17,305
- Hi.
- Hi there.

430
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:19,151
Your buddy here was about to 
be turned into orange goo.

431
00:35:19,273 --> 00:35:21,070
He picked a fight with a Dug ...

432
00:35:21,193 --> 00:35:23,582
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

433
00:35:23,713 --> 00:35:27,149
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

434
00:35:27,273 --> 00:35:31,107
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

435
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:33,032
Thanks, my young friend.

436
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,030
But mesa doen nutten!

437
00:35:45,193 --> 00:35:47,661
This storm will slow them down.

438
00:35:47,793 --> 00:35:49,226
Looks pretty bad.

439
00:35:50,513 --> 00:35:52,902
- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.

440
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:54,751
We'll be right there.

441
00:36:00,913 --> 00:36:02,983
Here, you'll like these pallies.

442
00:36:03,113 --> 00:36:05,581
- Here.
- Thank you.

443
00:36:06,713 --> 00:36:08,908
My bones are aching.

444
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:13,390
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

445
00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:16,232
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

446
00:36:16,353 --> 00:36:18,821
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

447
00:36:18,953 --> 00:36:21,228
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

448
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:25,062
Sandstorms are very, 
very dangerous.

449
00:36:25,193 --> 00:36:27,548
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

450
00:36:41,673 --> 00:36:42,822
Mom!

451
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:46,502
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

452
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:48,908
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

453
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:52,423
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

454
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:54,828
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

455
00:36:54,953 --> 00:36:56,830
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

456
00:37:06,233 --> 00:37:09,350
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

457
00:37:09,473 --> 00:37:10,701
He's wonderful.

458
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:13,551
You really like him?

459
00:37:13,673 --> 00:37:16,471
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

460
00:37:20,713 --> 00:37:21,941
Where is everybody?

461
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,188
Whoops.

462
00:37:26,273 --> 00:37:27,388
Oh, hello.

463
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:30,664
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

464
00:37:30,793 --> 00:37:32,590
How might I serve you?

465
00:37:32,713 --> 00:37:35,386
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

466
00:37:35,513 --> 00:37:38,903
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

467
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:42,667
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

468
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,865
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

469
00:37:47,713 --> 00:37:49,863
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

470
00:37:49,993 --> 00:37:52,905
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

471
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:58,505
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

472
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:03,230
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

473
00:38:07,673 --> 00:38:10,028
The death toll is catastrophic.

474
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:12,428
We must bow to their wishes.

475
00:38:12,553 --> 00:38:14,509
You must contact me.

476
00:38:14,633 --> 00:38:17,193
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

477
00:38:17,313 --> 00:38:19,224
Send no transmissions of any kind.

478
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:24,186
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

479
00:38:24,313 --> 00:38:28,101
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

480
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:30,588
Either way,
we're running out of time.

481
00:38:43,673 --> 00:38:45,709
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

482
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:48,506
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

483
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:50,430
Move against the Jedi first.

484
00:38:50,553 --> 00:38:53,147
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo ...

485
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:55,070
to sign the treaty.

486
00:38:55,193 --> 00:38:57,263
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

487
00:38:57,393 --> 00:38:59,702
At last we will have revenge.

488
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:02,586
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

489
00:39:02,713 --> 00:39:04,988
They will be no match for you.

490
00:39:09,673 --> 00:39:13,507
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

491
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:17,431
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

492
00:39:17,553 --> 00:39:20,909
- Any attempt to escape ―
- And they blow you up!

493
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,306
How wude!

494
00:39:23,433 --> 00:39:25,742
I can't believe there's still 
slavery in the galaxy.

495
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:27,670
The Republic's antislavery laws ―

496
00:39:27,793 --> 00:39:30,023
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

497
00:39:30,153 --> 00:39:32,223
We must survive on our own.

498
00:39:33,193 --> 00:39:34,626
Xcuse me.

499
00:39:36,633 --> 00:39:39,067
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

500
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:40,911
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

501
00:39:41,033 --> 00:39:43,627
Very fast, very dangerous.

502
00:39:44,393 --> 00:39:46,190
I'm the only human who can do it.

503
00:39:46,313 --> 00:39:49,191
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

504
00:39:50,273 --> 00:39:51,592
Don't do that again.

505
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:59,301
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

506
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:04,906
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

507
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:07,786
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.

508
00:40:07,913 --> 00:40:10,905
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

509
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,591
I don't think so.

510
00:40:12,713 --> 00:40:14,783
No one can kill a Jedi.

511
00:40:15,593 --> 00:40:17,549
I wish that were so.

512
00:40:17,673 --> 00:40:19,629
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

513
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:22,790
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

514
00:40:22,913 --> 00:40:26,110
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

515
00:40:26,233 --> 00:40:30,385
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

516
00:40:35,073 --> 00:40:37,712
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

517
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:40,711
We're on our way to Coruscant, the 
central system in the Republic ...

518
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,744
on a very important mission.

519
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:45,785
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

520
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:49,383
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

521
00:40:50,593 --> 00:40:53,665
I can help.
I can fix anything.

522
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:55,226
I believe you can.

523
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:58,026
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

524
00:40:58,153 --> 00:41:00,747
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

525
00:41:00,873 --> 00:41:04,263
These junk dealers must have 
a weakness of some kind.

526
00:41:04,393 --> 00:41:08,511
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

527
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:09,827
Podracing.

528
00:41:09,953 --> 00:41:12,751
Greed can be a powerful ally.

529
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:15,626
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

530
00:41:15,753 --> 00:41:17,948
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

531
00:41:18,073 --> 00:41:19,950
You could enter my pod.

532
00:41:20,873 --> 00:41:23,785
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

533
00:41:23,913 --> 00:41:25,710
You could make him think
it was yours ...

534
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,949
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.

535
00:41:28,073 --> 00:41:29,586
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

536
00:41:29,713 --> 00:41:32,102
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

537
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:34,269
But, Mom, I love it.

538
00:41:34,393 --> 00:41:37,783
The prize money would more than 
pay for the parts they need.

539
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:40,108
Anakin.

540
00:41:40,233 --> 00:41:42,872
Your mother's right.

541
00:41:42,993 --> 00:41:45,951
Is there anyone friendly to 
the Republic who can help us?

542
00:41:47,393 --> 00:41:48,985
No.

543
00:41:53,873 --> 00:41:58,310
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

544
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:05,706
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

545
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:07,664
We'll find some other way.

546
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:12,388
There is no other way.

547
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:16,665
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

548
00:42:17,513 --> 00:42:19,310
He was meant to help you.

549
00:42:32,313 --> 00:42:34,110
Are you sure about this?

550
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:36,747
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

551
00:42:36,873 --> 00:42:38,829
The queen will not approve.

552
00:42:38,953 --> 00:42:40,750
The queen doesn't need to know.

553
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:43,391
Well, I don't approve.

554
00:42:44,473 --> 00:42:46,987
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

555
00:42:47,113 --> 00:42:48,671
How can you do this?

556
00:42:48,793 --> 00:42:51,944
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

557
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:54,143
My ship will be the entry fee.

558
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:56,271
Not bad!

559
00:42:56,393 --> 00:42:59,226
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

560
00:42:59,353 --> 00:43:02,504
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

561
00:43:02,633 --> 00:43:05,022
What would the boy ride?

562
00:43:05,153 --> 00:43:08,543
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

563
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:10,903
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

564
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:12,591
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

565
00:43:12,713 --> 00:43:15,944
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

566
00:43:17,033 --> 00:43:19,388
That you did.

567
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,186
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

568
00:43:22,313 --> 00:43:24,702
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

569
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:26,425
The fastest ever built.

570
00:43:26,553 --> 00:43:31,468
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

571
00:43:33,353 --> 00:43:36,743
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee ...

572
00:43:36,873 --> 00:43:38,192
and I supply the boy.

573
00:43:38,313 --> 00:43:42,022
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

574
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:43,950
If it's going to be 50-50 ...

575
00:43:44,073 --> 00:43:46,587
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

576
00:43:46,713 --> 00:43:48,669
If we win ...

577
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:52,422
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

578
00:43:52,553 --> 00:43:55,625
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.

579
00:43:57,993 --> 00:43:59,346
Either way, you win.

580
00:44:04,913 --> 00:44:06,187
Deal!

581
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:25,711
What if this plan fails, Master?

582
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:28,427
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

583
00:44:28,553 --> 00:44:30,987
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help ...

584
00:44:31,113 --> 00:44:34,344
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

585
00:44:34,473 --> 00:44:36,350
And ...

586
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:38,270
there's something about this boy.

587
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:47,063
You should be very 
proud of your son.

588
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:50,023
He gives without any thought
of reward.

589
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:52,906
He knows nothing of greed.

590
00:44:53,033 --> 00:44:54,068
He has ―

591
00:44:55,033 --> 00:44:56,830
He has special powers.

592
00:44:58,553 --> 00:44:59,702
Yes.

593
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:02,347
He can see things
before they happen.

594
00:45:02,473 --> 00:45:05,146
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

595
00:45:05,273 --> 00:45:07,070
It's a Jedi trait.

596
00:45:07,193 --> 00:45:09,866
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

597
00:45:09,993 --> 00:45:13,224
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

598
00:45:15,553 --> 00:45:19,148
The Force is unusually strong 
with him. That much is clear.

599
00:45:19,273 --> 00:45:20,945
Who was his father?

600
00:45:23,553 --> 00:45:25,384
There was no father.

601
00:45:26,793 --> 00:45:29,990
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

602
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:33,222
I can't explain what happened.

603
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:36,551
Can you help him?

604
00:45:36,673 --> 00:45:38,470
I don't know.

605
00:45:40,873 --> 00:45:44,343
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

606
00:45:56,953 --> 00:45:58,750
Wow, a real astro droid!

607
00:46:00,593 --> 00:46:04,188
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

608
00:46:04,313 --> 00:46:07,146
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

609
00:46:07,273 --> 00:46:08,911
With this?

610
00:46:11,793 --> 00:46:14,865
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

611
00:46:14,993 --> 00:46:17,063
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

612
00:46:17,193 --> 00:46:20,344
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

613
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:30,828
Keep away from
those energy binders.

614
00:46:30,953 --> 00:46:34,263
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

615
00:46:34,393 --> 00:46:35,712
Okay.

616
00:46:39,273 --> 00:46:41,707
My tongue is fat.

617
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:44,791
My tongue ― Wrench.

618
00:46:44,913 --> 00:46:47,473
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

619
00:46:51,753 --> 00:46:53,232
I'm stuck.

620
00:46:53,353 --> 00:46:57,187
You know, I find that Jar Jar 
creature to be a little odd.

621
00:46:58,953 --> 00:47:01,672
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

622
00:47:01,793 --> 00:47:03,784
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

623
00:47:03,913 --> 00:47:06,029
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

624
00:47:06,153 --> 00:47:08,109
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

625
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:10,349
My mouth.

626
00:47:10,473 --> 00:47:11,747
Ani, I'm stuck.

627
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:18,823
My tongue is fat.

628
00:47:18,953 --> 00:47:21,786
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

629
00:47:23,913 --> 00:47:25,869
Thank you.

630
00:47:25,993 --> 00:47:27,346
Go.

631
00:47:41,273 --> 00:47:44,743
It's working!
It's working!

632
00:47:54,953 --> 00:47:57,342
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

633
00:47:57,473 --> 00:48:01,227
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

634
00:48:01,353 --> 00:48:03,150
Most of them.

635
00:48:03,273 --> 00:48:05,150
Has anyone been to 'em all?

636
00:48:06,793 --> 00:48:07,942
Not likely.

637
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:11,149
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

638
00:48:12,313 --> 00:48:14,588
Ani, bedtime!

639
00:48:14,713 --> 00:48:17,352
There we are.
Good as new.

640
00:48:17,473 --> 00:48:20,226
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

641
00:48:20,353 --> 00:48:23,629
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

642
00:48:23,753 --> 00:48:25,232
Go on.

643
00:48:25,353 --> 00:48:27,230
You have a big day tomorrow.

644
00:48:27,353 --> 00:48:29,150
Sleep well, Ani.

645
00:48:31,793 --> 00:48:33,704
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

646
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:36,427
I need an analysis of this 
blood sample I'm sending you.

647
00:48:36,553 --> 00:48:38,191
Wait a minute.

648
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,710
I need a midi-chlorian count.

649
00:48:44,553 --> 00:48:47,067
The reading is off the chart.

650
00:48:47,193 --> 00:48:48,990
Over 20,000.

651
00:48:49,113 --> 00:48:52,583
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

652
00:48:52,713 --> 00:48:54,431
No Jedi has.

653
00:48:54,553 --> 00:48:56,509
What does that mean?

654
00:48:57,353 --> 00:48:58,911
I'm not sure.

655
00:50:05,993 --> 00:50:08,746
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

656
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:10,545
Patience, my blue friend.

657
00:50:10,673 --> 00:50:12,823
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

658
00:50:12,953 --> 00:50:14,671
And we'll be far away from here.

659
00:50:14,793 --> 00:50:18,672
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

660
00:50:18,793 --> 00:50:22,024
I warn you, no funny business.

661
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:25,145
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

662
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:27,628
I have great faith in the boy.

663
00:50:27,753 --> 00:50:29,789
He's a credit to your race ...

664
00:50:29,913 --> 00:50:32,985
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

665
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:36,705
Oh, no!

666
00:50:40,713 --> 00:50:42,465
Why do you think that?

667
00:50:42,593 --> 00:50:44,390
He always wins!

668
00:50:46,313 --> 00:50:48,668
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

669
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:53,027
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

670
00:50:53,753 --> 00:50:56,950
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say ...

671
00:50:57,073 --> 00:50:58,870
the boy and his mother.

672
00:50:58,993 --> 00:51:02,542
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

673
00:51:03,433 --> 00:51:05,105
The boy, then.

674
00:51:11,073 --> 00:51:13,462
We'll let fate decide, huh?

675
00:51:13,593 --> 00:51:16,869
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

676
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:19,905
Blue, it's the boy.

677
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:21,102
Red ...

678
00:51:22,473 --> 00:51:24,031
his mother.

679
00:51:33,353 --> 00:51:35,662
You won this small toss,
outlander ...

680
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:37,829
but you won't win the race!

681
00:51:37,953 --> 00:51:39,944
So it makes little difference!

682
00:51:57,673 --> 00:52:00,062
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

683
00:52:00,193 --> 00:52:01,512
Good morning.

684
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:06,192
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

685
00:52:08,193 --> 00:52:12,027
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

686
00:52:12,153 --> 00:52:15,384
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

687
00:52:15,513 --> 00:52:16,548
Do what?

688
00:52:16,673 --> 00:52:19,585
Finish the race, of course.

689
00:52:19,713 --> 00:52:21,385
You've never won a race?

690
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,107
Well, not exactly.

691
00:52:24,233 --> 00:52:26,144
Not even finished?

692
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:28,628
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

693
00:52:28,753 --> 00:52:30,709
Of course you will.

694
00:52:59,153 --> 00:53:00,905
That's absolutely right.

695
00:53:01,033 --> 00:53:05,868
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

696
00:53:05,993 --> 00:53:09,463
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

697
00:53:11,473 --> 00:53:14,192
I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.

698
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:21,988
Two-time winner Boles Roor.

699
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:26,151
Sebulba!

700
00:53:36,153 --> 00:53:39,111
And in the front row,
nearside pole position ...

701
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:41,144
Mawhonic!

702
00:53:42,313 --> 00:53:44,269
A hearty hello ...

703
00:53:44,393 --> 00:53:47,942
to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

704
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:53,711
And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt ...

705
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:58,224
with that incredible racing 
machine, the Vulptereen 327.

706
00:54:01,433 --> 00:54:03,628
And hoping for a big win today ...

707
00:54:03,753 --> 00:54:07,985
Ody Mandrell, with his 
record-setting pit droid team.

708
00:54:12,673 --> 00:54:15,790
And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker ...

709
00:54:15,913 --> 00:54:17,141
a local boy.

710
00:54:19,753 --> 00:54:21,903
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

711
00:54:41,313 --> 00:54:42,792
Be safe.

712
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:45,143
I will, Mom. I promise.

713
00:55:15,553 --> 00:55:17,669
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

714
00:55:17,793 --> 00:55:19,351
Right.

715
00:55:23,313 --> 00:55:25,827
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

716
00:55:25,953 --> 00:55:29,548
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

717
00:55:29,673 --> 00:55:31,231
I will.

718
00:55:31,353 --> 00:55:33,469
May the Force be with you.

719
00:55:42,073 --> 00:55:43,984
Jabba the Hutt.

720
00:56:12,193 --> 00:56:15,230
Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.

721
00:56:16,393 --> 00:56:18,190
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

722
00:56:19,753 --> 00:56:22,506
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not ―

723
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:25,386
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

724
00:56:25,513 --> 00:56:27,629
You should too.

725
00:56:27,753 --> 00:56:29,744
You assume too much.

726
00:56:30,473 --> 00:56:32,782
Start your engines.

727
00:57:10,473 --> 00:57:13,670
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

728
00:57:32,873 --> 00:57:34,101
Oh, no!

729
00:57:39,513 --> 00:57:42,664
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

730
00:57:52,713 --> 00:57:56,752
It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

731
00:57:58,273 --> 00:57:59,501
Come on, Ani!

732
00:58:05,673 --> 00:58:07,186
And there goes Skywalker!

733
00:58:07,313 --> 00:58:08,712
Go, Ani, go!

734
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:10,869
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

735
00:59:21,953 --> 00:59:24,751
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out ...

736
00:59:24,873 --> 00:59:27,068
on the canyon dune turn.

737
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:41,382
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

738
01:00:07,993 --> 01:00:10,109
Oh, no!

739
01:00:14,713 --> 01:00:16,510
Where is Master Anakin?

740
01:00:19,633 --> 01:00:21,749
Look. Here he comes.

741
01:00:24,513 --> 01:00:26,743
It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.

742
01:00:27,593 --> 01:00:28,946
Yay! Yippee!

743
01:00:36,153 --> 01:00:39,589
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

744
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:46,230
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

745
01:02:41,793 --> 01:02:45,581
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

746
01:02:52,353 --> 01:02:53,991
Here he comes!

747
01:02:54,113 --> 01:02:57,105
At the start of the third and final 
lap, Sebulba's in the lead ...

748
01:02:57,233 --> 01:02:59,622
followed closely by Skywalker!

749
01:02:59,753 --> 01:03:00,583
Go, Ani!

750
01:03:26,513 --> 01:03:28,743
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

751
01:03:49,553 --> 01:03:50,872
It's Skywalker!

752
01:03:51,793 --> 01:03:53,067
Sebulba!

753
01:03:53,193 --> 01:03:57,266
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

754
01:03:57,393 --> 01:03:59,065
Did he crash-ed?

755
01:04:38,353 --> 01:04:41,425
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

756
01:05:32,273 --> 01:05:33,865
He's catching Sebulba!

757
01:05:34,953 --> 01:05:37,342
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

758
01:06:06,473 --> 01:06:08,748
That little human being
is out of his mind!

759
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:10,948
They're side by side!

760
01:06:38,433 --> 01:06:40,230
- Yippee!
- Yay!

761
01:06:44,273 --> 01:06:45,911
I can't believe it.

762
01:06:46,033 --> 01:06:47,864
The crowds are going nuts!

763
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,389
Yay, Ani!

764
01:06:59,673 --> 01:07:02,585
Mom, I did it! Yay!

765
01:07:12,673 --> 01:07:14,470
Good going, Ani!

766
01:07:18,673 --> 01:07:20,550
We owe you everything, Ani.

767
01:07:23,073 --> 01:07:25,109
It's so wonderful, Ani.

768
01:07:25,233 --> 01:07:27,827
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

769
01:07:27,953 --> 01:07:30,069
I'm so very proud of you.

770
01:07:40,113 --> 01:07:41,910
You!

771
01:07:42,033 --> 01:07:44,228
You swindled me.

772
01:07:44,353 --> 01:07:47,982
You knew the boy was going 
to win. Somehow you knew it.

773
01:07:48,113 --> 01:07:49,910
I lost everything.

774
01:07:50,033 --> 01:07:53,423
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you lose.

775
01:07:53,553 --> 01:07:55,908
Bring the parts
to the main hangar.

776
01:07:56,033 --> 01:07:58,991
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

777
01:07:59,113 --> 01:08:02,264
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

778
01:08:04,913 --> 01:08:08,223
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

779
01:08:08,353 --> 01:08:10,742
I'm sure they can settle this.

780
01:08:12,193 --> 01:08:13,990
Take him.

781
01:08:20,673 --> 01:08:21,662
Hidoe!

782
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:25,224
Well, we have all
the essential parts we need.

783
01:08:25,353 --> 01:08:26,342
I'm going back.

784
01:08:26,473 --> 01:08:28,464
Some unfinished business.
I won't be long.

785
01:08:28,593 --> 01:08:31,903
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

786
01:08:32,673 --> 01:08:35,665
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

787
01:08:35,793 --> 01:08:37,590
Get this hyperdrive
generator installed.

788
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:40,147
Yes, Master.
That shouldn't take long.

789
01:08:40,273 --> 01:08:42,343
Come on. Hup!

790
01:08:46,793 --> 01:08:48,590
Hey. These are yours.

791
01:08:50,513 --> 01:08:51,707
Yes!

792
01:08:53,193 --> 01:08:55,832
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

793
01:08:55,953 --> 01:08:58,228
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.

794
01:08:58,353 --> 01:09:01,186
- And he has been freed.
- What?

795
01:09:01,313 --> 01:09:03,031
You're no longer a slave.

796
01:09:04,873 --> 01:09:06,704
Did you hear that?

797
01:09:07,473 --> 01:09:09,828
Now you can make
your dreams come true, Ani.

798
01:09:10,673 --> 01:09:12,504
You are free.

799
01:09:15,953 --> 01:09:17,352
Will you take him with you?

800
01:09:17,473 --> 01:09:19,031
Is he to become a Jedi?

801
01:09:19,153 --> 01:09:21,587
Yes. Our meeting
was not a coincidence.

802
01:09:22,393 --> 01:09:23,985
Nothing happens by accident.

803
01:09:24,113 --> 01:09:27,503
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

804
01:09:27,633 --> 01:09:28,986
Anakin ...

805
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:33,984
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge ...

806
01:09:34,113 --> 01:09:36,866
and even if you succeed,
it's a hard life.

807
01:09:36,993 --> 01:09:40,030
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

808
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:42,869
Can I go, Mom?

809
01:09:43,793 --> 01:09:45,385
Anakin ...

810
01:09:45,513 --> 01:09:48,311
this path has been placed
before you.

811
01:09:48,433 --> 01:09:50,788
The choice is yours alone.

812
01:09:54,313 --> 01:09:56,110
I wanna do it.

813
01:09:58,593 --> 01:10:00,709
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

814
01:10:07,073 --> 01:10:08,586
What about Mom?

815
01:10:11,593 --> 01:10:13,390
Is she free too?

816
01:10:13,513 --> 01:10:16,869
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

817
01:10:17,873 --> 01:10:19,750
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

818
01:10:27,433 --> 01:10:30,630
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

819
01:10:30,753 --> 01:10:33,028
It is time for you to let go.

820
01:10:34,113 --> 01:10:36,149
I don't want things to change.

821
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:38,548
But you can't stop the change ...

822
01:10:38,673 --> 01:10:41,631
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

823
01:10:42,673 --> 01:10:44,504
I love you.

824
01:10:49,953 --> 01:10:51,750
Now hurry.

825
01:10:57,073 --> 01:10:58,392
Thank you.

826
01:10:58,513 --> 01:11:01,311
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.

827
01:11:03,473 --> 01:11:04,906
Will you be all right?

828
01:11:06,313 --> 01:11:07,712
Yeah.

829
01:11:12,553 --> 01:11:14,066
Hello, Master Anakin.

830
01:11:14,193 --> 01:11:16,184
Well, 3PO, I've been freed ...

831
01:11:16,313 --> 01:11:18,588
and I'm going away in a starship.

832
01:11:18,713 --> 01:11:21,511
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

833
01:11:21,633 --> 01:11:25,672
However, I should prefer it if 
I were a little more completed.

834
01:11:25,793 --> 01:11:28,785
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO ...

835
01:11:28,913 --> 01:11:30,869
give you coverings and all.

836
01:11:30,993 --> 01:11:32,551
I'm gonna miss working on you.

837
01:11:32,673 --> 01:11:35,028
You've been a great pal.

838
01:11:35,153 --> 01:11:37,667
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

839
01:11:38,433 --> 01:11:39,422
Sell me?

840
01:11:39,553 --> 01:11:41,111
Bye.

841
01:11:41,233 --> 01:11:42,552
Oh, my.

842
01:12:06,193 --> 01:12:08,309
I can't do it, Mom.
I just can't do it.

843
01:12:12,433 --> 01:12:14,344
Will I ever see you again?

844
01:12:15,753 --> 01:12:18,506
What does your heart tell you?

845
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:21,624
I hope so.

846
01:12:22,353 --> 01:12:24,150
Yes.

847
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:25,786
I guess.

848
01:12:26,793 --> 01:12:29,261
Then we will
see each other again.

849
01:12:31,873 --> 01:12:34,546
I will come back
and free you, Mom.

850
01:12:34,673 --> 01:12:36,311
I promise.

851
01:12:44,233 --> 01:12:47,066
Now, be brave ...

852
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:49,744
and don't look back.

853
01:12:50,513 --> 01:12:52,310
Don't look back.

854
01:13:35,073 --> 01:13:36,108
Qui-Gon, sir, wait!

855
01:13:36,233 --> 01:13:37,905
- I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

856
01:13:40,273 --> 01:13:41,183
Go!

857
01:13:42,193 --> 01:13:44,024
Tell them to take off!

858
01:13:56,113 --> 01:13:57,512
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

859
01:13:58,753 --> 01:14:00,072
Take off.

860
01:14:00,753 --> 01:14:02,425
Over there. Fly low.

861
01:14:23,153 --> 01:14:26,031
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

862
01:14:26,153 --> 01:14:27,632
What was it?

863
01:14:27,753 --> 01:14:29,425
I'm not sure ...

864
01:14:29,553 --> 01:14:31,987
but it was well-trained
in the Jedi arts.

865
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:34,508
My guess is
it was after the queen.

866
01:14:34,633 --> 01:14:37,022
What are we gonna do about it?

867
01:14:38,913 --> 01:14:40,471
We shall be patient.

868
01:14:40,593 --> 01:14:41,662
Anakin Skywalker ...

869
01:14:41,793 --> 01:14:43,511
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

870
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:48,267
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.

871
01:14:56,873 --> 01:14:59,307
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving ...

872
01:14:59,433 --> 01:15:01,344
and you, Governor,
are going to die ...

873
01:15:01,473 --> 01:15:03,509
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.

874
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:06,022
This invasion
will gain you nothing.

875
01:15:06,153 --> 01:15:09,031
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

876
01:15:09,153 --> 01:15:10,950
Take him away.

877
01:15:14,273 --> 01:15:16,628
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps ...

878
01:15:16,753 --> 01:15:19,187
for these rumoured
underwater villages.

879
01:15:19,313 --> 01:15:21,827
They will not
stay hidden for long.

880
01:15:32,433 --> 01:15:35,027
The death toll is catastrophic.

881
01:15:35,153 --> 01:15:37,667
We must bow to their wishes.

882
01:15:37,793 --> 01:15:39,909
You must contact me.

883
01:15:53,473 --> 01:15:55,304
You all right?

884
01:15:56,313 --> 01:15:58,144
It's very cold.

885
01:16:05,793 --> 01:16:08,432
You come from
a warm planet, Ani.

886
01:16:08,553 --> 01:16:10,828
A little too warm
for my taste.

887
01:16:10,953 --> 01:16:13,103
Space is cold.

888
01:16:13,233 --> 01:16:15,269
You seem sad.

889
01:16:16,393 --> 01:16:18,543
The queen is worried.

890
01:16:18,673 --> 01:16:20,982
Her people are suffering, dying.

891
01:16:21,113 --> 01:16:24,469
She must convince the senate
to intervene or ...

892
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:28,068
I'm not sure what'll happen.

893
01:16:29,473 --> 01:16:31,429
I made this for you ...

894
01:16:32,873 --> 01:16:34,670
so you'd remember me.

895
01:16:35,353 --> 01:16:37,913
I carved it
out of a japor snippet.

896
01:16:38,033 --> 01:16:40,752
It'll bring you good fortune.

897
01:16:40,873 --> 01:16:42,670
It's beautiful.

898
01:16:42,793 --> 01:16:45,068
But I don't need this
to remember you by.

899
01:16:48,593 --> 01:16:51,824
Many things will change when 
we reach the capital, Ani ...

900
01:16:51,953 --> 01:16:54,387
but my caring for you will remain.

901
01:16:56,993 --> 01:16:59,985
I care for you, too, only I ―

902
01:17:00,113 --> 01:17:02,183
Miss your mother.

903
01:17:19,913 --> 01:17:23,906
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

904
01:17:24,033 --> 01:17:25,705
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

905
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:28,950
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

906
01:17:57,233 --> 01:18:00,145
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

907
01:18:00,273 --> 01:18:03,106
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

908
01:18:03,233 --> 01:18:05,588
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.

909
01:18:05,713 --> 01:18:08,227
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

910
01:18:08,353 --> 01:18:10,230
Welcome, Your Highness.

911
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:12,309
It's an honour to finally
meet you in person.

912
01:18:12,433 --> 01:18:13,832
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

913
01:18:13,953 --> 01:18:17,309
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

914
01:18:17,433 --> 01:18:20,709
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

915
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:24,791
I'm grateful for your concern,
Chancellor.

916
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:26,710
There is a question
of procedure ...

917
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:29,222
but I'm confident
we can overcome it.

918
01:18:30,033 --> 01:18:32,103
I must speak with the 
Jedi Council immediately.

919
01:18:32,233 --> 01:18:34,906
The situation has become
much more complicated.

920
01:18:40,433 --> 01:18:42,264
Ani, come on.

921
01:18:53,033 --> 01:18:55,627
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

922
01:18:56,913 --> 01:18:58,790
Pitty hot.

923
01:19:25,553 --> 01:19:28,545
There is no civility,
only politics.

924
01:19:29,793 --> 01:19:33,502
The Republic
is not what it once was.

925
01:19:33,633 --> 01:19:38,661
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

926
01:19:39,433 --> 01:19:42,709
There is no interest
in the common good.

927
01:19:43,553 --> 01:19:45,111
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

928
01:19:45,233 --> 01:19:47,827
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

929
01:19:47,953 --> 01:19:50,547
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

930
01:19:50,673 --> 01:19:52,470
If I may say so, Your Majesty ...

931
01:19:52,593 --> 01:19:54,709
the chancellor
has little real power.

932
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:58,542
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

933
01:19:58,673 --> 01:20:02,268
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

934
01:20:02,993 --> 01:20:05,746
Our best choice would be
to push for the election ...

935
01:20:05,873 --> 01:20:07,989
of a stronger
supreme chancellor ...

936
01:20:08,113 --> 01:20:10,183
one who could control
the bureaucrats ...

937
01:20:10,313 --> 01:20:12,065
and give us justice.

938
01:20:12,913 --> 01:20:18,192
You could call for a vote of no 
confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

939
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:20,702
He has been
our strongest supporter.

940
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:25,827
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

941
01:20:25,953 --> 01:20:29,150
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

942
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:32,024
Our people are dying, Senator.

943
01:20:32,793 --> 01:20:35,671
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

944
01:20:35,793 --> 01:20:38,182
To be realistic, Your Majesty ...

945
01:20:38,313 --> 01:20:40,702
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control ...

946
01:20:40,833 --> 01:20:43,222
for the time being.

947
01:20:44,913 --> 01:20:46,904
That is something I cannot do.

948
01:20:53,953 --> 01:20:56,421
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

949
01:20:56,553 --> 01:21:00,307
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

950
01:21:00,433 --> 01:21:01,752
Impossible.

951
01:21:01,873 --> 01:21:04,433
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

952
01:21:04,553 --> 01:21:08,546
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.

953
01:21:09,513 --> 01:21:11,629
Hard to see,
the dark side is.

954
01:21:11,753 --> 01:21:14,506
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

955
01:21:14,633 --> 01:21:17,705
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

956
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:19,425
May the Force be with you.

957
01:21:23,313 --> 01:21:24,712
Master Qui-Gon.

958
01:21:25,553 --> 01:21:27,271
More to say have you?

959
01:21:29,313 --> 01:21:31,110
With your permission, my master ...

960
01:21:32,593 --> 01:21:35,471
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

961
01:21:36,553 --> 01:21:38,464
A vergence, you say.

962
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:40,629
Located around a person?

963
01:21:40,753 --> 01:21:41,947
A boy.

964
01:21:42,073 --> 01:21:44,462
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians ...

965
01:21:44,593 --> 01:21:46,311
I have seen in a life-form.

966
01:21:46,433 --> 01:21:49,186
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

967
01:21:50,833 --> 01:21:54,542
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.

968
01:21:55,313 --> 01:21:57,349
You believe it's this boy?

969
01:21:57,473 --> 01:21:59,941
- I don't presume to ―
- But you do.

970
01:22:00,673 --> 01:22:02,550
Revealed your opinion is.

971
01:22:02,673 --> 01:22:04,629
I request the boy be tested,
Master.

972
01:22:06,673 --> 01:22:09,745
Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?

973
01:22:09,873 --> 01:22:12,148
Finding him
was the will of the Force.

974
01:22:12,273 --> 01:22:14,423
I have no doubt of that.

975
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:22,789
Bring him before us, then.

976
01:22:33,433 --> 01:22:35,230
The boy's here to see Padmé.

977
01:22:35,353 --> 01:22:36,866
Let him in.

978
01:22:39,953 --> 01:22:43,662
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmé's
not here right now.

979
01:22:43,793 --> 01:22:45,385
Who is it?

980
01:22:46,153 --> 01:22:49,031
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.

981
01:22:49,153 --> 01:22:50,871
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

982
01:22:50,993 --> 01:22:52,790
I'm on my way
to the Jedi temple ...

983
01:22:52,913 --> 01:22:55,063
to start my training, I hope.

984
01:22:55,873 --> 01:22:59,548
I may never see her again,
so I came to say goodbye.

985
01:23:00,593 --> 01:23:04,063
We will tell her for you.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

986
01:23:05,153 --> 01:23:06,142
Thank you, Your Highness.

987
01:23:19,593 --> 01:23:23,506
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

988
01:23:30,033 --> 01:23:33,264
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate ...

989
01:23:34,353 --> 01:23:36,628
a tragedy has occurred ...

990
01:23:36,753 --> 01:23:40,109
which started right here with 
the taxation of trade routes ...

991
01:23:40,233 --> 01:23:43,111
and has now engulfed
our entire planet ...

992
01:23:43,233 --> 01:23:45,144
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

993
01:23:45,993 --> 01:23:47,346
This is outrageous!

994
01:23:47,473 --> 01:23:49,907
I object
to the senator's statements.

995
01:23:50,033 --> 01:23:53,912
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

996
01:23:54,033 --> 01:23:57,742
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala ...

997
01:23:57,873 --> 01:23:59,784
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo ...

998
01:23:59,913 --> 01:24:01,710
who speaks on our behalf.

999
01:24:07,473 --> 01:24:10,112
Honourable representatives
of the Republic ...

1000
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:13,188
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

1001
01:24:13,313 --> 01:24:16,066
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade ―

1002
01:24:16,193 --> 01:24:19,583
I object!
There is no proof!

1003
01:24:19,713 --> 01:24:21,510
This is incredible.

1004
01:24:21,633 --> 01:24:25,421
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1005
01:24:25,553 --> 01:24:26,781
The Congress of Malastare ...

1006
01:24:26,913 --> 01:24:29,791
concurs with the honourable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1007
01:24:29,913 --> 01:24:31,869
A commission must be appointed.

1008
01:24:31,993 --> 01:24:34,382
- The point ―
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

1009
01:24:34,513 --> 01:24:36,071
Enter the bureaucrat.

1010
01:24:36,193 --> 01:24:38,707
The true rulers of the Republic.

1011
01:24:38,833 --> 01:24:42,826
And on the payroll of the 
Trade Federation, I might add.

1012
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:46,992
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1013
01:24:48,513 --> 01:24:50,708
The point is conceded.

1014
01:24:50,833 --> 01:24:53,347
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission ...

1015
01:24:53,473 --> 01:24:56,146
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

1016
01:24:56,273 --> 01:24:58,070
I will not defer.

1017
01:24:58,193 --> 01:25:01,549
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1018
01:25:01,673 --> 01:25:04,551
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die ...

1019
01:25:04,673 --> 01:25:07,233
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1020
01:25:10,073 --> 01:25:12,303
If this body
is not capable of action ...

1021
01:25:12,433 --> 01:25:14,389
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1022
01:25:17,673 --> 01:25:19,789
I move for a vote
of no confidence ...

1023
01:25:19,913 --> 01:25:21,824
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1024
01:25:28,593 --> 01:25:30,663
Vote now! Vote now!

1025
01:25:34,313 --> 01:25:36,144
Order!

1026
01:25:36,273 --> 01:25:39,026
Now they will elect
a new chancellor ...

1027
01:25:39,153 --> 01:25:40,950
a strong chancellor ...

1028
01:25:41,073 --> 01:25:43,871
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.

1029
01:25:45,513 --> 01:25:49,586
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1030
01:25:49,713 --> 01:25:52,705
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

1031
01:25:52,833 --> 01:25:55,427
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.

1032
01:25:55,553 --> 01:25:58,147
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1033
01:25:59,993 --> 01:26:03,588
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1034
01:26:03,713 --> 01:26:05,669
They will not go along
with you this time.

1035
01:26:07,113 --> 01:26:09,581
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1036
01:26:12,753 --> 01:26:14,072
A ship.

1037
01:26:15,633 --> 01:26:17,510
A cup.

1038
01:26:17,633 --> 01:26:19,351
A ship.

1039
01:26:20,433 --> 01:26:21,832
A speeder.

1040
01:26:29,073 --> 01:26:30,904
How feel you?

1041
01:26:31,473 --> 01:26:33,065
Cold, sir.

1042
01:26:34,673 --> 01:26:36,743
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

1043
01:26:37,873 --> 01:26:40,387
See through you we can.

1044
01:26:40,513 --> 01:26:42,310
Be mindful of your feelings.

1045
01:26:42,433 --> 01:26:45,072
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1046
01:26:46,673 --> 01:26:48,026
I miss her.

1047
01:26:49,233 --> 01:26:51,588
Afraid to lose her,
I think, mmm?

1048
01:26:51,713 --> 01:26:53,749
What has that got to do
with anything?

1049
01:26:53,873 --> 01:26:56,103
Everything.

1050
01:26:56,233 --> 01:26:59,145
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1051
01:26:59,273 --> 01:27:02,026
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

1052
01:27:02,153 --> 01:27:05,350
Hate leads to suffering.

1053
01:27:11,633 --> 01:27:14,431
I sense much fear in you.

1054
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:30,064
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

1055
01:27:30,193 --> 01:27:31,467
I don't know.

1056
01:27:32,753 --> 01:27:34,550
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1057
01:27:36,913 --> 01:27:38,869
I hope not.

1058
01:27:39,633 --> 01:27:41,749
Gungans no die'n without a fight.

1059
01:27:41,873 --> 01:27:43,670
Wesa warriors.

1060
01:27:43,793 --> 01:27:46,910
Wesa got a grand army.

1061
01:27:47,033 --> 01:27:50,105
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1062
01:27:50,233 --> 01:27:51,507
Your Highness?

1063
01:27:54,073 --> 01:27:56,109
Your Highness ...

1064
01:27:56,233 --> 01:27:59,191
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum ...

1065
01:27:59,313 --> 01:28:00,632
as supreme chancellor.

1066
01:28:00,753 --> 01:28:04,462
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

1067
01:28:04,593 --> 01:28:08,791
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1068
01:28:08,913 --> 01:28:10,505
Who else has been nominated?

1069
01:28:10,633 --> 01:28:14,751
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1070
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:19,583
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1071
01:28:21,233 --> 01:28:23,144
I will be chancellor.

1072
01:28:23,273 --> 01:28:25,741
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator ...

1073
01:28:25,873 --> 01:28:28,945
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.

1074
01:28:29,073 --> 01:28:30,870
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1075
01:28:30,993 --> 01:28:34,383
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1076
01:28:36,113 --> 01:28:39,742
Senator, this is your arena.

1077
01:28:40,113 --> 01:28:41,944
I feel I must return to mine.

1078
01:28:45,073 --> 01:28:47,268
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1079
01:28:47,393 --> 01:28:48,223
Go back?

1080
01:28:48,353 --> 01:28:51,186
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1081
01:28:51,313 --> 01:28:53,588
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1082
01:28:53,713 --> 01:28:56,386
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1083
01:28:56,513 --> 01:28:58,026
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1084
01:28:58,153 --> 01:29:00,348
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

1085
01:29:00,473 --> 01:29:02,270
Stay here where it's safe.

1086
01:29:03,713 --> 01:29:06,750
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1087
01:29:07,473 --> 01:29:11,432
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1088
01:29:20,753 --> 01:29:23,221
The Force is strong with him.

1089
01:29:23,353 --> 01:29:25,184
He is to be trained, then?

1090
01:29:27,233 --> 01:29:29,508
No, he will not be trained.

1091
01:29:29,633 --> 01:29:31,225
No?

1092
01:29:33,193 --> 01:29:35,149
He is too old.

1093
01:29:35,273 --> 01:29:38,902
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

1094
01:29:40,033 --> 01:29:43,423
Clouded this boy's future is.

1095
01:29:45,553 --> 01:29:47,305
I will train him, then.

1096
01:29:51,473 --> 01:29:54,192
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.

1097
01:29:54,313 --> 01:29:57,111
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1098
01:29:57,233 --> 01:29:59,508
Impossible to take on a second.

1099
01:29:59,633 --> 01:30:01,225
The code forbids it.

1100
01:30:01,353 --> 01:30:04,584
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1101
01:30:04,713 --> 01:30:08,183
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

1102
01:30:09,153 --> 01:30:11,667
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force ...

1103
01:30:11,793 --> 01:30:13,431
but he is capable.

1104
01:30:13,553 --> 01:30:15,464
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1105
01:30:17,953 --> 01:30:21,582
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

1106
01:30:21,713 --> 01:30:24,181
Now is not the time for this.

1107
01:30:24,953 --> 01:30:26,830
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor ...

1108
01:30:26,953 --> 01:30:29,513
and Queen Amidala
is returning home ...

1109
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:32,705
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1110
01:30:32,833 --> 01:30:35,028
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1111
01:30:35,153 --> 01:30:39,351
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1112
01:30:40,593 --> 01:30:42,072
This is the clue we need ...

1113
01:30:42,193 --> 01:30:44,661
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.

1114
01:30:45,353 --> 01:30:47,469
May the Force be with you.

1115
01:31:00,113 --> 01:31:02,866
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1116
01:31:02,993 --> 01:31:04,790
From your point of view.

1117
01:31:04,913 --> 01:31:08,144
The boy is dangerous. They all 
sense it. Why can't you?

1118
01:31:08,273 --> 01:31:11,026
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1119
01:31:11,153 --> 01:31:13,428
The council will decide
Anakin's future.

1120
01:31:13,553 --> 01:31:16,351
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1121
01:31:21,793 --> 01:31:25,388
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1122
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:27,629
You won't be, Ani.

1123
01:31:27,753 --> 01:31:29,584
I'm not allowed to train you ...

1124
01:31:29,713 --> 01:31:31,669
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.

1125
01:31:31,793 --> 01:31:33,784
Always remember:

1126
01:31:34,673 --> 01:31:37,187
Your focus determines your reality.

1127
01:31:37,313 --> 01:31:40,749
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.

1128
01:31:40,873 --> 01:31:42,192
Master, sir ...

1129
01:31:42,313 --> 01:31:45,749
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.

1130
01:31:45,873 --> 01:31:49,229
I've been wondering ―
What are midi-chlorians?

1131
01:31:50,473 --> 01:31:52,748
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form ...

1132
01:31:52,873 --> 01:31:55,023
that resides
within all living cells.

1133
01:31:56,433 --> 01:31:59,186
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1134
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:02,623
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1135
01:32:02,753 --> 01:32:06,462
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1136
01:32:06,593 --> 01:32:09,346
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist ...

1137
01:32:09,473 --> 01:32:12,146
and we would have
no knowledge of the Force.

1138
01:32:12,273 --> 01:32:14,070
They continually speak to us ...

1139
01:32:14,193 --> 01:32:16,753
telling us the will of the Force.

1140
01:32:16,873 --> 01:32:18,864
When you learn
to quiet your mind ...

1141
01:32:18,993 --> 01:32:20,790
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1142
01:32:20,913 --> 01:32:22,710
I don't understand.

1143
01:32:22,833 --> 01:32:26,189
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1144
01:32:30,073 --> 01:32:33,668
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1145
01:32:34,353 --> 01:32:35,706
I welcome your help.

1146
01:32:35,833 --> 01:32:39,382
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1147
01:32:39,513 --> 01:32:42,391
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1148
01:32:42,513 --> 01:32:45,266
Wesa goin' home!

1149
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:47,190
Come on, R2.

1150
01:32:57,033 --> 01:32:59,308
Is the planet secure?

1151
01:32:59,433 --> 01:33:03,142
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1152
01:33:03,273 --> 01:33:06,231
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1153
01:33:06,353 --> 01:33:09,390
Good. I will see to it
that in the senate ...

1154
01:33:09,513 --> 01:33:12,311
things stay as they are.

1155
01:33:12,433 --> 01:33:15,789
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.

1156
01:33:15,913 --> 01:33:17,710
Yes, my lord.

1157
01:33:17,833 --> 01:33:19,630
A Sith here?

1158
01:33:24,833 --> 01:33:27,188
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1159
01:33:27,313 --> 01:33:29,588
And those two control the pitch?

1160
01:33:31,113 --> 01:33:32,910
You catch on pretty quick.

1161
01:33:33,033 --> 01:33:34,705
As soon as we land ...

1162
01:33:34,833 --> 01:33:37,347
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1163
01:33:37,473 --> 01:33:38,462
I agree.

1164
01:33:38,593 --> 01:33:41,232
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

1165
01:33:41,353 --> 01:33:43,708
I will take back what's ours.

1166
01:33:44,473 --> 01:33:46,543
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

1167
01:33:46,673 --> 01:33:48,470
We have no army.

1168
01:33:48,593 --> 01:33:49,912
And I can only protect you.

1169
01:33:50,033 --> 01:33:51,989
I can't fight a war for you.

1170
01:33:52,993 --> 01:33:53,982
Jar Jar Binks.

1171
01:33:54,873 --> 01:33:56,943
Mesa, Your Highness?

1172
01:33:57,073 --> 01:33:59,871
Yes. I need your help.

1173
01:34:04,913 --> 01:34:07,029
I have one battleship on my scope.

1174
01:34:07,153 --> 01:34:09,109
It's a droid control ship.

1175
01:34:09,233 --> 01:34:11,349
They've probably spotted us.

1176
01:34:11,473 --> 01:34:13,111
We haven't much time.

1177
01:34:24,353 --> 01:34:26,913
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1178
01:34:27,033 --> 01:34:28,261
Good.

1179
01:34:28,393 --> 01:34:30,543
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1180
01:34:30,673 --> 01:34:32,231
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.

1181
01:34:34,233 --> 01:34:36,463
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1182
01:34:38,193 --> 01:34:41,151
I'm sorry for
my behaviour, Master.

1183
01:34:41,273 --> 01:34:44,822
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1184
01:34:46,673 --> 01:34:49,824
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1185
01:34:50,953 --> 01:34:52,750
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

1186
01:34:54,153 --> 01:34:56,713
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

1187
01:34:57,393 --> 01:35:00,590
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1188
01:35:13,073 --> 01:35:15,348
Desa nobody dare!

1189
01:35:15,473 --> 01:35:17,543
The Gungan city is deserted!

1190
01:35:17,673 --> 01:35:20,107
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1191
01:35:20,233 --> 01:35:23,191
Do you think they have 
been taken to the camps?

1192
01:35:23,313 --> 01:35:25,543
More likely they were wiped out.

1193
01:35:25,673 --> 01:35:28,585
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?

1194
01:35:28,713 --> 01:35:31,989
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1195
01:35:32,113 --> 01:35:34,866
Mesa show you.
Come on. Mesa show you!

1196
01:35:52,473 --> 01:35:55,909
Your Honour,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1197
01:36:02,313 --> 01:36:05,510
Heyo dadee
Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.

1198
01:36:06,273 --> 01:36:08,582
Jar Jar Binks.

1199
01:36:09,073 --> 01:36:12,190
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1200
01:36:12,753 --> 01:36:14,948
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1201
01:36:15,753 --> 01:36:18,062
I come before you in peace.

1202
01:36:18,193 --> 01:36:20,912
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1203
01:36:21,033 --> 01:36:24,070
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1204
01:36:24,193 --> 01:36:27,742
Yousa all bombad.

1205
01:36:28,593 --> 01:36:31,312
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1206
01:36:31,433 --> 01:36:32,752
Your Honour.

1207
01:36:34,833 --> 01:36:37,666
Whosa dis?

1208
01:36:37,793 --> 01:36:39,909
I am Queen Amidala.

1209
01:36:41,513 --> 01:36:43,026
This is my decoy ...

1210
01:36:43,153 --> 01:36:46,623
my protection,
my loyal bodyguard.

1211
01:36:46,753 --> 01:36:50,871
I'm sorry for my deception, but it 
was necessary to protect myself.

1212
01:36:50,993 --> 01:36:53,427
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honour ...

1213
01:36:53,553 --> 01:36:55,987
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1214
01:36:57,713 --> 01:37:00,750
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1215
01:37:00,873 --> 01:37:03,990
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1216
01:37:04,113 --> 01:37:06,229
I ask you to help us.

1217
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:08,947
No, I beg you to help us.

1218
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:11,348
We are your humble servants.

1219
01:37:14,473 --> 01:37:17,146
Our fate is in your hands.

1220
01:37:33,673 --> 01:37:37,746
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1221
01:37:40,113 --> 01:37:43,867
Mesa lika dis!

1222
01:37:44,873 --> 01:37:45,703
Maybe ...

1223
01:37:45,833 --> 01:37:48,267
wesa ...

1224
01:37:48,393 --> 01:37:50,190
being friends.

1225
01:37:58,553 --> 01:38:00,271
We've sent our patrols.

1226
01:38:00,393 --> 01:38:03,703
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1227
01:38:03,833 --> 01:38:05,903
It won't be long, my lord.

1228
01:38:06,033 --> 01:38:09,025
This is
an unexpected move for her.

1229
01:38:09,153 --> 01:38:11,064
It's too aggressive.

1230
01:38:11,193 --> 01:38:13,502
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1231
01:38:13,633 --> 01:38:16,067
Let them make the first move.

1232
01:38:16,193 --> 01:38:17,990
Yes, my master.

1233
01:38:21,393 --> 01:38:22,985
Deysa comin!

1234
01:38:23,113 --> 01:38:24,387
All right!

1235
01:38:27,833 --> 01:38:29,471
They're here!

1236
01:38:29,593 --> 01:38:30,912
Good. They made it.

1237
01:38:35,313 --> 01:38:37,873
Yousa doen grand.

1238
01:38:37,993 --> 01:38:40,951
Jar Jar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.

1239
01:38:41,073 --> 01:38:42,870
Oh, no, no, no.

1240
01:38:42,993 --> 01:38:45,826
So, wesa make you ...

1241
01:38:45,953 --> 01:38:48,342
bombad general.

1242
01:38:48,473 --> 01:38:49,826
General?

1243
01:38:52,793 --> 01:38:54,192
Captain.

1244
01:38:54,313 --> 01:38:56,781
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1245
01:38:56,913 --> 01:38:58,710
Almost everyone's in camps.

1246
01:38:58,833 --> 01:39:01,905
A few hundred police and guards formed
an underground resistance movement.

1247
01:39:02,033 --> 01:39:04,467
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1248
01:39:04,593 --> 01:39:07,346
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought ...

1249
01:39:07,473 --> 01:39:09,065
and much stronger.

1250
01:39:10,313 --> 01:39:13,271
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1251
01:39:13,393 --> 01:39:15,509
The battle is a diversion.

1252
01:39:15,633 --> 01:39:18,386
The Gungans must draw the droid 
army away from the cities.

1253
01:39:18,513 --> 01:39:19,992
R2.

1254
01:39:21,073 --> 01:39:24,383
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1255
01:39:24,513 --> 01:39:26,151
Once we get
to the main entrance ...

1256
01:39:26,273 --> 01:39:29,231
Captain Panaka
will create a diversion.

1257
01:39:29,353 --> 01:39:32,151
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1258
01:39:32,873 --> 01:39:35,546
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1259
01:39:35,673 --> 01:39:37,265
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1260
01:39:37,393 --> 01:39:39,463
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1261
01:39:39,593 --> 01:39:41,982
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1262
01:39:42,113 --> 01:39:44,308
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1263
01:39:44,433 --> 01:39:48,949
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1264
01:39:49,073 --> 01:39:52,224
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1265
01:39:52,353 --> 01:39:55,345
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1266
01:39:55,473 --> 01:39:57,270
We will send
what pilots we have ...

1267
01:39:57,393 --> 01:40:00,305
to knock out the droid control 
ship orbiting the planet.

1268
01:40:00,433 --> 01:40:03,345
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1269
01:40:03,473 --> 01:40:06,465
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1270
01:40:06,593 --> 01:40:08,151
There's an even bigger danger.

1271
01:40:08,273 --> 01:40:10,070
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness ...

1272
01:40:10,193 --> 01:40:12,309
he will return
with another droid army.

1273
01:40:12,433 --> 01:40:15,505
Well, that is why we must 
not fail to get the viceroy.

1274
01:40:15,633 --> 01:40:17,464
Everything depends on it.

1275
01:40:22,593 --> 01:40:25,107
She is more foolish
than I thought.

1276
01:40:25,233 --> 01:40:27,110
We are sending all troops ...

1277
01:40:27,233 --> 01:40:29,986
to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1278
01:40:30,113 --> 01:40:32,627
It appears to be made up
of primitives.

1279
01:40:32,753 --> 01:40:35,187
This will work to our advantage.

1280
01:40:35,313 --> 01:40:37,986
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1281
01:40:38,753 --> 01:40:40,391
Wipe them out.

1282
01:40:42,033 --> 01:40:43,830
All of them.

1283
01:41:13,473 --> 01:41:14,792
Halt!

1284
01:41:18,113 --> 01:41:20,263
Starting up the shield.

1285
01:41:48,593 --> 01:41:49,742
Open fire.

1286
01:42:05,193 --> 01:42:08,265
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1287
01:42:08,393 --> 01:42:10,224
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1288
01:42:25,553 --> 01:42:27,509
Roger, roger.

1289
01:42:35,233 --> 01:42:38,225
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1290
01:42:39,273 --> 01:42:40,706
This is too close.

1291
01:42:46,433 --> 01:42:48,708
Ani, find cover.

1292
01:42:48,833 --> 01:42:51,028
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1293
01:43:47,393 --> 01:43:48,462
Fighters straight ahead.

1294
01:43:48,593 --> 01:43:49,662
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1295
01:43:49,793 --> 01:43:50,942
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1296
01:43:59,273 --> 01:44:00,308
Cease fire.

1297
01:44:07,553 --> 01:44:09,862
Steady. Steady.

1298
01:44:41,633 --> 01:44:44,705
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1299
01:45:00,553 --> 01:45:02,384
Ouch time.

1300
01:45:15,913 --> 01:45:16,948
Fire!

1301
01:45:38,313 --> 01:45:40,065
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1302
01:45:40,193 --> 01:45:41,592
Red group! Blue group!

1303
01:45:41,713 --> 01:45:43,431
Everybody, this way!

1304
01:45:43,553 --> 01:45:45,509
Hey, wait for me!

1305
01:45:45,633 --> 01:45:47,908
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1306
01:45:48,033 --> 01:45:49,944
- But I ―
- Stay in that cockpit.

1307
01:46:01,633 --> 01:46:04,705
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1308
01:46:24,073 --> 01:46:25,904
We gotta do something, R2.

1309
01:46:47,793 --> 01:46:50,671
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1310
01:46:53,993 --> 01:46:56,905
Oops, wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.

1311
01:46:57,873 --> 01:47:00,224
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1312
01:47:02,353 --> 01:47:03,263
Yeah!

1313
01:47:08,433 --> 01:47:09,866
Let's go!

1314
01:47:10,913 --> 01:47:13,063
It's on automatic pilot.

1315
01:47:21,793 --> 01:47:23,590
Try to override it.

1316
01:48:21,193 --> 01:48:23,024
We don't have time for this,
Captain.

1317
01:48:28,913 --> 01:48:30,665
Look, there they are.

1318
01:48:30,793 --> 01:48:33,068
That's where
the autopilot's taking us.

1319
01:48:49,393 --> 01:48:51,907
Dumb droid. Take that!

1320
01:48:52,033 --> 01:48:53,864
Get off! Get off! Get off!

1321
01:48:53,993 --> 01:48:55,108
Get off!

1322
01:49:04,753 --> 01:49:07,028
The deflector shield
is too strong.

1323
01:49:15,953 --> 01:49:17,545
This is tense!

1324
01:49:19,753 --> 01:49:21,664
R2, get us off this autopilot.

1325
01:49:21,793 --> 01:49:23,590
It's gonna get us both killed.

1326
01:49:25,193 --> 01:49:27,502
You did it, R2!

1327
01:49:27,633 --> 01:49:28,782
Let's go left.

1328
01:49:33,793 --> 01:49:34,862
Go back?

1329
01:49:34,993 --> 01:49:39,111
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this 
cockpit, so that's what I'm gonna do.

1330
01:49:45,713 --> 01:49:48,068
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.

1331
01:49:53,513 --> 01:49:55,947
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.

1332
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:03,468
Go!

1333
01:50:08,113 --> 01:50:09,751
Ascension guns!

1334
01:52:10,753 --> 01:52:12,311
Retreat! Retreat!

1335
01:52:13,993 --> 01:52:15,824
Dis is nutsen.

1336
01:52:25,313 --> 01:52:27,190
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1337
01:52:47,073 --> 01:52:49,382
Give me a lift!

1338
01:52:56,353 --> 01:52:57,866
Jar Jar, usen da booma!

1339
01:52:57,993 --> 01:52:59,824
What?
Mesa no have a booma!

1340
01:52:59,953 --> 01:53:01,830
Here. Taken dis one.

1341
01:53:17,593 --> 01:53:18,628
Jar Jar!

1342
01:53:18,753 --> 01:53:20,630
Jump, Jar Jar, jump!

1343
01:53:30,393 --> 01:53:33,066
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1344
01:53:45,473 --> 01:53:47,509
We're hit, R2!

1345
01:54:00,193 --> 01:54:03,026
I'm trying to stop!
I'm trying to stop!

1346
01:54:09,953 --> 01:54:11,432
Everything's overheated.

1347
01:54:12,833 --> 01:54:14,710
Oops. This is not good.

1348
01:55:24,193 --> 01:55:26,309
No giben up, General Jar Jar.

1349
01:55:26,433 --> 01:55:28,230
Mesa think of something.

1350
01:55:28,353 --> 01:55:29,672
Hands up.

1351
01:55:29,793 --> 01:55:32,546
My give up. My give up.

1352
01:55:40,913 --> 01:55:43,905
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1353
01:55:44,033 --> 01:55:45,830
Time for you
to sign the treaty and end ...

1354
01:55:45,953 --> 01:55:47,750
this pointless debate in the senate.

1355
01:55:47,873 --> 01:55:49,545
Viceroy!

1356
01:55:49,673 --> 01:55:51,504
Your occupation here has ended.

1357
01:55:53,033 --> 01:55:56,264
After her.
This one's a decoy.

1358
01:56:02,593 --> 01:56:03,992
Captain!

1359
01:56:12,873 --> 01:56:14,829
Jam the doors.

1360
01:56:18,153 --> 01:56:20,906
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1361
01:57:21,513 --> 01:57:23,902
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.

1362
01:57:27,073 --> 01:57:28,062
Take this!

1363
01:57:29,993 --> 01:57:31,028
And this!

1364
01:57:38,593 --> 01:57:40,265
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1365
01:57:40,393 --> 01:57:42,145
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1366
01:57:42,273 --> 01:57:43,592
Impossible!

1367
01:57:43,713 --> 01:57:45,510
Nothing can get through our shield.

1368
01:57:46,753 --> 01:57:48,471
Let's get outta here.

1369
01:57:56,193 --> 01:57:58,707
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1370
01:58:01,633 --> 01:58:03,146
We didn't hit it.

1371
01:58:06,113 --> 01:58:08,069
Now, this is Podracing.

1372
01:58:09,633 --> 01:58:11,271
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!

1373
01:58:31,793 --> 01:58:33,192
What the ―

1374
01:58:33,313 --> 01:58:35,429
Was'n they doing?

1375
01:58:35,553 --> 01:58:38,989
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!

1376
01:58:40,633 --> 01:58:42,863
They all broke-ed.

1377
01:59:29,313 --> 01:59:32,544
No, it's too late.

1378
01:59:32,673 --> 01:59:34,868
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1379
01:59:36,113 --> 01:59:37,910
Promise ―

1380
01:59:38,033 --> 01:59:40,467
Promise me
you will train the boy.

1381
01:59:40,593 --> 01:59:42,072
Yes, Master.

1382
01:59:45,993 --> 01:59:48,461
He is the chosen one.

1383
01:59:48,593 --> 01:59:51,665
He will bring balance.

1384
01:59:52,833 --> 01:59:54,186
Train him.

1385
02:00:20,593 --> 02:00:22,311
Now, Viceroy ...

1386
02:00:22,433 --> 02:00:25,709
you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.

1387
02:00:27,393 --> 02:00:30,544
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise goodbye.

1388
02:00:43,713 --> 02:00:47,103
We are indebted to you
for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1389
02:00:47,233 --> 02:00:49,030
And you, young Skywalker.

1390
02:00:49,793 --> 02:00:52,944
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1391
02:00:59,233 --> 02:01:01,667
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.

1392
02:01:01,793 --> 02:01:05,069
Your boldness has saved our 
people, Your Majesty.

1393
02:01:05,193 --> 02:01:07,468
It's you who should be
congratulated.

1394
02:01:07,593 --> 02:01:11,347
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1395
02:01:16,193 --> 02:01:20,425
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.

1396
02:01:20,553 --> 02:01:25,069
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner ...

1397
02:01:25,193 --> 02:01:26,990
I do not.

1398
02:01:27,113 --> 02:01:29,104
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1399
02:01:31,913 --> 02:01:34,473
The chosen one the boy may be.

1400
02:01:34,593 --> 02:01:36,151
Nevertheless ...

1401
02:01:36,273 --> 02:01:39,026
grave danger I fear
in his training.

1402
02:01:39,153 --> 02:01:43,112
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1403
02:01:43,233 --> 02:01:45,064
I will train Anakin.

1404
02:01:47,233 --> 02:01:49,463
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

1405
02:01:49,593 --> 02:01:51,948
Qui-Gon's defiance
I sense in you.

1406
02:01:52,073 --> 02:01:53,904
Need that you do not.

1407
02:01:56,073 --> 02:01:59,190
Agree with you the council does.

1408
02:02:00,273 --> 02:02:03,424
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1409
02:02:30,113 --> 02:02:31,785
What will happen to me now?

1410
02:02:31,913 --> 02:02:34,825
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1411
02:02:34,953 --> 02:02:38,229
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1412
02:02:47,273 --> 02:02:50,504
There's no doubt the 
mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1413
02:02:50,633 --> 02:02:52,988
Always two there are.

1414
02:02:53,113 --> 02:02:56,185
No more, no less.

1415
02:02:56,313 --> 02:02:59,111
A master and an apprentice.

1416
02:02:59,233 --> 02:03:00,712
But which was destroyed?

1417
02:03:00,833 --> 02:03:03,666
The master or the apprentice?

1418
02:03:27,313 --> 02:03:29,269
Hidoe, everybody!

1419
02:04:13,993 --> 02:04:15,824
Peace!
