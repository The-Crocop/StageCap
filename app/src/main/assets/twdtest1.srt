1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,238
Previously on
AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:03,358 --> 00:00:05,859
That exit sends
them right at us.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,561
We force them west here...

4
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:08,762
Away from the community.

5
00:00:08,862 --> 00:00:11,064
They'll follow a path if
something's drawing them.

6
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,067
Carter!

7
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:14,067
Sh sh sh.

8
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:15,335
You gotta be quiet.

9
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:17,437
Why don't you head back?

10
00:00:17,538 --> 00:00:18,504
Tell everyone what's happening.

11
00:00:20,274 --> 00:00:20,839
They got
inside the walls.

12
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:22,841
They're killing
people.

13
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:24,510
Leave!

14
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:26,492
My people have guns...

15
00:00:26,612 --> 00:00:28,696
...yours don't.

16
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:46,363
Try again.

17
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:49,267
Tobin, it's not stopping.
Light it up. You hear me?

18
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:53,137
Tobin!

19
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,838
- Michonne.
- Got it.

20
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,576
Shit! Shit!
It was half.

21
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:01,112
Jesus, it was more than half.

22
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:02,646
We just gotta stay
ahead of them.

23
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:04,414
They walk, we run.

24
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:06,182
<i>- Rick!</i>
<i>- I'm here.</i>

25
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:07,551
<i>What's going on back there?</i>

26
00:01:07,552 --> 00:01:09,519
Half of them broke off.

27
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:11,188
<i>They're going toward Alexandria.</i>

28
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:16,591
Towards you?

29
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:19,094
We ran ahead.
There's a horn or something.

30
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:21,697
Loud, coming from the east.
It's not stopping.

31
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:24,067
I'm gonna gas it up, turn back.

32
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:26,602
<i>We have it.
You keep going.</i>

33
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:28,070
They're gonna need our help.

34
00:01:28,073 --> 00:01:30,271
Gotta keep the herd moving.

35
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:31,906
Not if it's
going down, <i>we don't.</i>

36
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:33,540
The rest of that herd
turns around,

37
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:35,243
the bad back there gets worse.

38
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:39,546
<i>Daryl?</i>

39
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,049
Yeah, I heard you.

40
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:52,426
Nicholas.

41
00:01:52,427 --> 00:01:55,096
- Ah!
- You okay?

42
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:57,230
It's my ankle.

43
00:01:57,233 --> 00:02:00,100
All right, come on.
Grab on. Let's go.

44
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:01,734
Come on.

45
00:02:01,736 --> 00:02:03,837
It's coming from back home.

46
00:02:03,838 --> 00:02:05,938
- It has to be.
- He did this.

47
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:08,908
He brought us all
out here to die.

48
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:11,044
- He killed Carter.
- Carter was dead already.

49
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:13,913
Now they're in trouble
back there and we're done.

50
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:16,983
- We're good as dead.
- Hey, calm down.

51
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:18,450
What the hell
are you talking about?

52
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:21,152
We are done.
And it's 'cause of him.

53
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:23,487
Shut up and move.

54
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,424
Come on.

55
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:34,665
Damn it.

56
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:37,735
All right, listen up.
Here's the new plan.

57
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:41,072
I go back, get the RV, circle
around the woods on Redding.

58
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:42,973
I'll get in front of them
before they get there.

59
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:44,408
I can lead them away again.

60
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:46,343
RV's a mile back.
I can go with you.

61
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:48,346
I'll handle it.
Just get home.

62
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:50,081
They might need you there.

63
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:53,283
Glenn, Michonne.

64
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:56,485
If something's in front
of you, you kill it.

65
00:02:56,487 --> 00:02:58,855
No hiding, no waiting.
You keep going.

66
00:02:58,858 --> 00:03:00,824
I'm going with you. You
can't do this on your own.

67
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:02,792
- Glenn, I can do this.
- You need to help me.

68
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:05,461
- We've got to get these people back.
- Yeah.

69
00:03:05,463 --> 00:03:09,132
Thing is, they aren't
all gonna make it.

70
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:11,300
- Rick.
- You try to save them, you try,

71
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:13,634
but they can't keep up,
you keep going.

72
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:16,538
You have to. You make
sure you get back.

73
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:28,949
Oh, God!

74
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:32,152
Oh, God!

75
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:57,043
The horn stopped. Good.

76
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:12,858
Get back safe.

77
00:04:50,680 --> 00:05:00,985
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

78
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,189
We're ahead of it.
10 minutes.

79
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:09,430
20 minutes, maybe.

80
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:13,434
We all keep up the pace,
we all get back home.

81
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:17,771
So if we don't, that's it, huh?

82
00:05:17,773 --> 00:05:19,639
We don't even
know what's waiting for us.

83
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:22,375
It's gonna be okay.
We have walls for a reason.

84
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:25,177
That sound. Maybe someone
plowed right through.

85
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,711
Maybe we're walking
back to nothing.

86
00:05:26,713 --> 00:05:29,014
Shh, my wife's back there.

87
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:32,918
Mine, too.

88
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,654
Look, don't worry
about what's gone wrong.

89
00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:37,555
Figure out how
to make this go right.

90
00:05:37,557 --> 00:05:40,358
We're moving in the same
direction everything else is.

91
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,893
We're gonna catch up
with something.

92
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:43,661
We're gonna catch up
with a lot of things

93
00:05:43,663 --> 00:05:45,896
and we're gonna end them.

94
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:47,999
We have no choice.

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,968
We gotta keep going forward.

96
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:06,916
Stay here.

97
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:08,786
Don't shoot unless you have to.

98
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,500
Come on.
That's us.

99
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:54,961
<i>Sturgess!</i>

100
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:54,617
I know what it means.

101
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:03,125
We gotta keep moving, right?

102
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:08,999
Hey, we gone five miles out yet?

103
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,365
Give or take some yardage.

104
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:12,134
You got a reason for asking?

105
00:08:12,136 --> 00:08:15,137
Next intersection we're gonna
spin around and go back.

106
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:17,173
The plan is to go 15 more.

107
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:20,009
Yeah, I'm gonna change that.
Five's gonna have to work.

108
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:23,680
The magic number's 20.
That's the mission.

109
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:26,649
That's making sure they're off
munching on infirm raccoons

110
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:29,283
the rest of their undead lives
instead of any of us.

111
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:31,853
<i>You want to go,
we can't stop you.</i>

112
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:34,489
But without you,
they could stop us.

113
00:09:34,001 --> 00:09:35,221
- Can I take a look?
- Please.

114
00:08:55,844 --> 00:08:59,746
Nah, I got faith in you.

115
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:01,813
<i>- Daryl!</i>
<i>- Don't do it, man!</i>

116
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:40,192
Is it bad?

117
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:42,927
It's about what you'd expect.

118
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:45,029
Huh, didn't expect this.

119
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,571
How long you been married?

120
00:09:53,572 --> 00:09:56,407
Three months.

121
00:09:56,408 --> 00:09:58,375
She wasn't my wife from before.

122
00:09:58,376 --> 00:10:00,443
How'd you meet?

123
00:10:01,438 --> 00:10:05,349
It was early on.

124
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,135
Aaron found me.

125
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,402
I was alone, lost everything.

126
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:12,937
Everyone.

127
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,374
Myself, I--
I wasn't crazy.

128
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:20,778
I just gave up on being someone,

129
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,048
an actual person.

130
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:25,982
<i>Know what I mean?</i>

131
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:28,753
I do.

132
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:32,623
We found Betsy on the way
back to the community.

133
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:37,094
She still saw me.

134
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:39,062
After I thought
I was dead and gone,

135
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:41,397
she was my first friend.

136
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,899
<i>Then she was more.</i>

137
00:10:43,902 --> 00:10:46,269
<i>She made me more.</i>

138
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,404
<i>Even better than</i>
<i>how I used to be.</i>

139
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:54,043
But if I could make it back,
I'd want to say good-bye.

140
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:57,013
Tell her...

141
00:10:57,014 --> 00:11:00,615
finding her in all this,

142
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,985
that was everything.

143
00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:10,058
We need to stop
and bandage him up.

144
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:13,928
No, we keep moving.
I'm okay.

145
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:16,197
You won't be if we don't
stop your bleeding.

146
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,268
We'll find a place.

147
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:23,804
Can't stop out
in the open too long.

148
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:27,207
Come on.

149
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:36,015
Let's check if these
cars work first.

150
00:11:36,018 --> 00:11:38,150
See if they can get us back.

151
00:11:38,153 --> 00:11:40,220
I'll stay with them.

152
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:09,580
Listen, I need to get home,

153
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:12,082
but I'm not leaving them behind.

154
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:15,153
We patch Scott up, we get going.

155
00:12:15,154 --> 00:12:17,922
Rick knows what he knows.

156
00:12:17,923 --> 00:12:19,691
We're ahead of the herd.

157
00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:21,725
Maybe half an hour now.

158
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:24,061
We can stop.
We can make it.

159
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:31,368
This is halfway home, right?

160
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,037
Yeah.

161
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:37,073
This is where it happened.

162
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:41,376
I said it at the dealership.

163
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:43,611
Me and Aiden didn't know
what we were doing.

164
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:46,982
The people
on your crew who died?

165
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:51,921
They weren't afraid.

166
00:12:51,923 --> 00:12:53,722
We were.

167
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:03,798
<i>No luck.</i>

168
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:05,734
We have to stay on foot.

169
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:09,037
Nicholas was here last.

170
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,105
He can show us the way.

171
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:16,711
Uh, okay.

172
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:20,647
All right.

173
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:28,388
There's no cars.

174
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:32,959
I got you.
I got you.

175
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:47,240
Oh, Jesus.

176
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:48,974
Sturgess?

177
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:54,113
He left us behind.

178
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:33,950
Herd's that way.

179
00:14:35,986 --> 00:14:37,519
Shit.

180
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:44,558
- Nicholas.
- Uh...

181
00:15:31,871 --> 00:15:33,605
We stay quiet,

182
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:35,441
patch Scott and Annie up,

183
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:36,942
get out of here.

184
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:40,078
Those walkers in the alley
and down the street,

185
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:42,380
they're blocking
the way out of town.

186
00:15:42,383 --> 00:15:46,184
We can't take 'em on, not
in the shape that we're in.

187
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:49,019
We'll have to lead them
away if we have to.

188
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:51,188
Because that's been
working well lately.

189
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:55,293
I'm trying here.

190
00:15:55,294 --> 00:15:57,261
I'm not giving up.

191
00:15:57,264 --> 00:15:59,697
Yeah, not yet.

192
00:16:03,969 --> 00:16:06,971
Hey, I was thinking,

193
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:09,538
if we can find a way to
distract the herd coming in,

194
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,375
then they won't make it
back to the community.

195
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:12,609
How?

196
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,711
Burn one of the buildings.

197
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:16,480
Hopefully more.

198
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:18,615
They'll get drawn to it
and they'll stop here.

199
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:20,649
It's gonna take some time.

200
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:22,784
I'll do it.
You stay with them.

201
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:24,921
It's my plan.
It's on me.

202
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:27,222
You have a wife, Glenn.

203
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:29,792
That's why I'm doing this.

204
00:16:29,793 --> 00:16:31,659
You've got to get
everybody back.

205
00:16:31,662 --> 00:16:33,929
You're the one who can.

206
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:36,198
If I take too long, you just go.

207
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:38,299
I'm not leaving without you.

208
00:16:38,302 --> 00:16:41,469
- That is not the way this works.
- I will meet you there.

209
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,639
If I get stuck out here, I'll find
some way to show you guys I'm okay.

210
00:16:46,142 --> 00:16:48,243
We all have a job to do.

211
00:16:52,414 --> 00:16:53,948
There's a feed store.

212
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:57,118
It's old.
A lot of dry stuff inside.

213
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,684
It should go up easy.

214
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:01,254
I'll go with you.

215
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:06,492
I can--
I can draw a map.

216
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:09,029
No.

217
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:11,432
You lead the way.

218
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:12,798
Just gotta do one thing first.

219
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:53,104
<i>Rick, it's Glenn.</i>

220
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:56,173
<i>We're in a town five degrees
east of the green marker.</i>

221
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:59,176
If you get around on Redding in the
next 20 minutes, <i>you should be good.</i>

222
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,511
<i>I think that's how far</i>
<i>we're ahead of the herd.</i>

223
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:05,048
I'm gonna try to set a fire
<i>and distract them.</i>

224
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:07,817
If you don't see smoke,
they're still coming your way.

225
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:16,093
<i>I got to go.</i>

226
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,095
<i>Good luck, dumbass.</i>

227
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:01,315
<i>That'll keep you going until
we get you back to the infirmary.</i>

228
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:04,585
Annie, I'm gonna figure
out a crutch for you.

229
00:19:04,586 --> 00:19:07,121
Just leave me.

230
00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:08,855
What?

231
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:12,727
I'm slowing you down.

232
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:15,295
We're gonna hit more roamers.

233
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:17,163
It's that simple.

234
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:19,231
Leave me.

235
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:21,734
Leave us.

236
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,971
No.

237
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:27,874
It's stupid for you
guys to wait on me.

238
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,409
We'll all go down.

239
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:34,346
Come on, man, wake up.

240
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:36,315
You don't want to do it now,

241
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:38,884
you do it out there.

242
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:42,153
We get into trouble
again, you run.

243
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:45,656
- And you don't look back.
- No, if we go, we go together.

244
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:49,027
We got each other's backs
just like always.

245
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:52,230
Okay, we don't leave
people behind.

246
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:56,101
Not us.

247
00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:01,873
No one is leaving anyone behind.

248
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:09,645
I'm gonna find something
for you, Annie.

249
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:28,463
Hey.

250
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:31,333
Do you have a problem with me?

251
00:20:32,802 --> 00:20:34,936
I'm just looking out
for my people.

252
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,875
And you think that I'm not?

253
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:44,980
Look, I heard what Rick said.

254
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:49,416
Which part?

255
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:53,488
How they wouldn't all make it.

256
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,423
They meaning us and not you.

257
00:20:57,425 --> 00:21:00,326
How you should leave us
behind if we can't keep up.

258
00:21:00,328 --> 00:21:03,798
Glenn is out there risking his
life for you and for everyone else

259
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:07,101
and I'm still here, so I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

260
00:21:07,103 --> 00:21:09,568
Things are gonna get worse
and then we'll see.

261
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,006
Yeah, we will.

262
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,411
Rick said what he said

263
00:21:18,413 --> 00:21:21,314
because sometimes
you don't have a choice.

264
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:23,048
That is not how we do it.

265
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,317
Because you've never had
to do it any other way.

266
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,353
You haven't been through it, not really.

267
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:29,654
- Michonne--
- Not like Rick.

268
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:32,825
Rick was out there.
I was out there.

269
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:34,659
We know, you don't.

270
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:36,862
But if you don't learn,
you will die, we will.

271
00:21:36,864 --> 00:21:38,830
I've been doing runs
from the start, okay?

272
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,165
- I know what it's like.
- Have you ever had to kill people

273
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,468
because they had already killed your
friends and were coming for you next?

274
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,305
Have you ever done things that made you
feel afraid of yourself afterward?

275
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,973
Have you ever been
covered in so much blood

276
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:53,310
that you didn't know if it was yours
or walkers' or your friends'?

277
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:56,213
Huh?

278
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,883
Then you don't know.

279
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,082
Wait.

280
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:34,415
It should be me.

281
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:41,055
He was on my crew.

282
00:22:41,057 --> 00:22:44,157
His name was Will.

283
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,659
He was 19.

284
00:22:46,827 --> 00:22:48,363
We left him behind.

285
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:54,968
You're not that guy anymore.

286
00:22:56,836 --> 00:22:59,538
<i>Hey, you are here now.</i>

287
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,574
You are not that guy anymore.

288
00:23:03,743 --> 00:23:05,545
Okay.

289
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,906
Shit.

290
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:37,607
Is that home?

291
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:39,477
We need to go now.

292
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:47,951
<i>Okay. Okay, let's go.</i>

293
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:49,420
Come on.

294
00:23:50,489 --> 00:23:52,788
We gotta go now.

295
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:07,170
<i>The ones from down
the street and in the alley,</i>

296
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:09,372
they're getting drawn
by the gunfire.

297
00:24:21,717 --> 00:24:24,919
Soon as they clear,
we head for the feed store.

298
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,521
<i>Till then we sit tight,
keep quiet.</i>

299
00:26:48,888 --> 00:26:50,390
<i>They heard that.</i>

300
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:58,963
They know we're in here now.
We can't wait them out.

301
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:01,366
The herd, it's gonna
be here any minute.

302
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:06,904
What?

303
00:27:16,414 --> 00:27:18,450
They're coming.

304
00:27:30,144 --> 00:27:31,678
Go!

305
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,413
Come on!

306
00:27:33,414 --> 00:27:35,682
Where's the feed store?

307
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:38,017
- Go! The other end of town. We can try--
- We can't.

308
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:39,752
Glenn said we got to go.
We go now.

309
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:47,160
Ah!

310
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:50,628
Just run!

311
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:55,099
Go!

312
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:18,823
It's just up ahead.
We light it up and we go.

313
00:28:23,894 --> 00:28:26,195
There's gotta be
another building.

314
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:37,540
- We gotta go.
- Um...

315
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:43,712
<i>- Where?!</i>
<i>- Uh, uh...</i>

316
00:28:45,548 --> 00:28:47,281
- Nicholas!
- This way.

317
00:28:47,284 --> 00:28:49,050
- This-- this way.
- Go! Go!

318
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,528
You go over first,
and then we'll help Scott.

319
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,863
No, they're coming.
Just go.

320
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,065
We're doing this.
Come on.

321
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,230
Come on!

322
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:41,701
Come on!

323
00:29:47,773 --> 00:29:50,107
<i>No!</i>

324
00:30:03,622 --> 00:30:06,022
Damn it.

325
00:31:30,903 --> 00:31:32,336
We gotta go.

326
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:35,339
We gotta keep going.
We don't have a choice.

327
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:37,643
We don't have a choice.
Come on!

328
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:52,490
Up here!
Up here!

329
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,580
Nicholas!

330
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:56,250
Hey, Nicholas!

331
00:32:56,251 --> 00:32:57,884
Nicholas!
Look at me.

332
00:32:57,886 --> 00:33:02,288
Hey, look at me!
Look at me!

333
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,991
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>
<i>Nicholas!</i>

334
00:33:04,993 --> 00:33:06,727
Look at me!

335
00:33:10,498 --> 00:33:12,530
Thank you.

336
00:34:42,028 --> 00:34:44,161
Come on.
Come on.

337
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:45,896
Come on.

338
00:35:07,675 --> 00:35:09,585
Come on.

339
00:35:17,512 --> 00:35:19,394
<i>There's no smoke.</i>

340
00:35:19,396 --> 00:35:21,530
It doesn't mean
they didn't make it.

341
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:28,652
The herd's still coming, but this
creek should slow them down some.

342
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:24,751
Glenn.

343
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:27,072
I'm in place by my best guess.

344
00:36:27,193 --> 00:36:29,175
You guys make it back yet?

345
00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:34,079
Glenn.

346
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,755
Tobin, you there?

347
00:36:48,561 --> 00:36:50,195
Daryl?

348
00:36:52,032 --> 00:36:53,298
<i>I'm here.</i>

349
00:36:56,302 --> 00:36:58,304
<i>Won't be long now.</i>

350
00:36:58,306 --> 00:37:00,168
<i>They're almost here.</i>

351
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:02,742
<i>I'll get them going</i>
<i>your way again.</i>

352
00:37:02,744 --> 00:37:04,876
How 'bout that, Daryl?

353
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:07,177
<i>He's gonna be coming our way.</i>

354
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:20,094
There's gunfire
coming from back home.

355
00:37:20,336 --> 00:37:23,503
We gotta sit with it
and hope they can handle it.

356
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:26,139
I think they can.
They have to.

357
00:37:26,141 --> 00:37:29,443
We keep going forward for them.

358
00:37:29,445 --> 00:37:32,579
<i>Can't turn back</i>
<i>'cause we're afraid.</i>

359
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,215
We ain't afraid.

360
00:37:36,217 --> 00:37:38,583
<i>This is for them.</i>

361
00:37:38,585 --> 00:37:42,264
Going back now before it's
done, that'd be for us.

362
00:37:50,429 --> 00:37:52,965
<i>The herd has
to be almost here.</i>

363
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,313
Rick?

364
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,981
Rick?

365
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:04,398
Rick?

366
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:08,135
Rick?

367
00:42:10,907 --> 00:42:14,844
<i>No, no, no, no, no. No.</i>
